    "text": "Q1:\nWhy do we first resize to a large size on the CPU, and then to a smaller size on the GPU?\n____\n* Reisizing images is done image per image on cpu, while transformation is done one gpu. This method is called presizing: - crop the image and resize it to 460 by 460 first, this operation is done on CPU. - then we do the data augmentation in batches, by cropping a rotated random part of that 460^2 image, and taking the cropped image then resize again to a 224 by 224 image, all this operation are done on batch level, which mean on GPU\nQ2:\nIf you are not familiar with regular expressions, find a regular expression tutorial, and some problem sets, and complete them. Have a look on the book’s website for suggestions.\n___\n* Will write serie of blog posts about Regular Expression\nQ3:\nWhat are the two ways in which data is most commonly provided, for most deep learning datasets?\n___\n* Data is usually provided as : - Individual files like images of text - Comma separted Values csv.\nQ4:\nLook up the documentation for L and try using a few of the new methods that it adds.\n____\n* Later\nQ5:\nLook up the documentation for the Python pathlib module and try using a few methods of the Path class.\n___\n* Later\nQ6:\nGive two examples of ways that image transformations can degrade the quality of the data\n____\n\nInterpolations lead to an image with pixel values that are estimated using estimated pixel values which loses quality each time.\nRotating an image 45 degrees creates empty space in the corners.\n\nQ7:\nWhat method does fastai provide to view the data in a DataLoaders?\n___\nDataLoader.show_batch\nQ8:\nWhat method does fastai provide to help you debug a DataBlock?\n___\nDataBlock.summary\nQ9:\nShould you hold off on training a model until you have thoroughly cleaned your data?\n___\n* No. It’s better to start using the building a model as soon as possible, we could even use it as data cleaning tool.**\nQ10:\nWhat method does fastai provide to help you debug a DataBlock?\n___\n* Plot_Confusion_Matrix: for displaying where the model make bad predictions the most. * Plot_Top_Losses: A method that displays the images with the highest loss value.\nQ11:\nWhat are the two pieces that are combined into cross-entropy loss in PyTorch?\n___\n* Softmax function and Negative Log Likelihood Loss.\nQ12:\nWhat are the two properties of activations that softmax ensures? Why is this important?\n____\n* It make sure all activations add uo to 1 * It help the model to pick one class\nQ13:\nWhen might you want your activations to not have these two properties?\n____\n* When we have multi-label classification, more than one label for one image.\nQ14:\nCalculate the exp and softmax columns of &lt;&gt; yourself (i.e., in a spreadsheet, with a calculator, or in a notebook).\n___\nLater\nQ15:\nWhy can’t we use torch.where to create a loss function for datasets where our label can have more than two categories?\n___\n* When we have more than 2 classes to class torch.where it’s not ideal, because it build only to select 1 between 2 categories.\nQ16:\nWhat is the value of log(-2)? Why?\n____\n* The logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function, which mean logarithm of a value is the result of that value after applying the exponential, and there’s no number that can result a nigative number after the exponential, so log(-2) = not defined\nQ17:\nWhat are two good rules of thumb for picking a learning rate from the learning rate finder?\n___\n* Pick Learning rate smaller 10x than the minimum value of loss * Use the learning rate at the last point that the loss value was decreasing.\nQ18:\nWhat two steps does the fine_tune method do?\n____\n* Train the added layer using random weights for one epoch * Unfreeze all the layers and train them all together as normal model for number of epochs\nQ19:\nIn Jupyter notebook, how do you get the source code for a method or function?\n____\n* By using ?? after the function.\nQ20:\nWhat are discriminative learning rates?\n____\n* It’s a method that allow us to use different learning rate for each part of the neural network. Using a pretrained model means that the earlier layers are trained for many epochs which mean that the parameters don’t need to be updated by much, in other hand the last layers needs to be matched with task we have. That’s why it’s good to pick slightly smaller value for learning rate for the earlier layers, and bigger one for the last ones.\nQ21:\nHow is a Python slice object interpreted when passed as a learning rate to fastai?\n____\n* The first value in the slice object sets the lowest learning rate. * The second value in the slice object sets the highest learning rate."

For example, we may want a model that would predict crimes, but we use information on arrests as a proxy . However, this data itself is slightly biased due to the biases in existing policing processes. Training with this data leads to a biased model.

What is a test set? Why do we need them?\nValidation set is small portion of the data set that we preserve from the training fase in order to prevent the model from memorizing the data instead of learning from it. The validation set allow us to measure the performance of the model on data that the model didn’t see before.

What make it different from CPU? and Why do we need it to do Deep Learning tasks:\n\nGPU stands for Graphic Processing Unit, is a specialized processor with dedicated memory that conventionally perform floating point operations required for rendering graphics.\nIn other words, it’s a single-chip processor used for extensive graphical and mathematical computations which help the CPU to achieve other tasks.\nWhile CPU is designed to handel the complex logic in code once at a time, GPU can do many small operations at the same time, which make it very convenient to deep learning where we need to do many milions of calculations in order to train a model\n\n\nWhy do Deep Learning needs GPU?\n\nGPUs are optimized for training neural networks models as they can process multiple computations simultaneously.\nFor example the model we’ve fine-tuned in chapter one resnet18 which the smaller version of resnet models with only 18 hidden layers,though it has more than 11 millions parameters, in order to do one epoch and calculate all these parameter (wights + biases) and multiply them by the input variables (images) then do the Back-probagation and update them after calculating the loss … all this multiplications will take a large amount of time if we did it on CPU."

Why?\n___\n* MNIST_SAMPLE contains two folders Train and Valid.\n* This method of structuring dataset help the community to compare the results between models by setting the same framework.\nQ3:\nExplain how the “pixel similarity” approach to classifying digits works.\n___\n* First we turn images in tensor, then we stack them together. * we take the mean value of each pixel for all images, this will give us an image that each pixel of it represent the mean of all datset. * Then we classify images by comparing the mean absolute error between that image and the ideal3/ideal7 and see which return low distance.\nQ4:\nWhat is a list comprehension? Create one now that selects odd numbers from a list and doubles them.\n___\n\n# list with odd and even numbers\nlisst =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 31, 17, 70]\n# using list-comprehension to select only odd numbers\ndouble_odd = [2*i for i in lisst if i%2==1]\ndouble_odd\n\n[2, 6, 10, 62, 34]\n\n\nQ5:\nWhat is a “rank-3 tensor”?\n___ * It’s a tensor with 3 dimensions, each can be represented as an array (array of array of array), it’s basically a cube.\nQ6:\nWhat is the difference between tensor rank and shape? How do you get the rank from the shape?\n____\n* Rank represent the dimesion of the tensorm while shape tells how many elemen there’s in each dimension.\nQ7:\nWhat are RMSE and L1 norm?\n___\n* RMSE also called L2 stands dor Root Mean Square Error, while L1 is Least Absolute Error. * This functions are basically the same, we used them to measure distance.\nQ9:\nCreate a 3x3 tensor or array containing the numbers from 1 to 9. Double it. Select the bottom right 4 numbers.\n___\n\nimport torch\n\n\nr3_tens = torch.Tensor(list(range(1,10))).view(3,3)\nr3_tens\n\ntensor([[1., 2., 3.],\n        [4., 5., 6.],\n        [7., 8., 9.]])\n\n\n\ndouble_tens= 2*r3_tens\ndouble_tens\n\ntensor([[ 2.,  4.,  6.],\n        [ 8., 10., 12.],\n        [14., 16., 18.]])\n\n\n\ndouble_tens[1:, 1:]\n\ntensor([[10., 12.],\n        [16., 18.]])\n\n\nQ10:\nWhat is broadcasting?\n___\n* It refers to mathematical operation between different dimensions arrays and tensors.\nQ11:\nAre metrics generally calculated using the training set, or the validation set? Why?\n_____ * Metrics are calculated on validation set, so we have good measure of the model performance.\nQ12&13:\nWhat is SGD?\nWhy does SGD use mini-batches?\n____ * SGD or Stochastic Gradient Descent is an optimization function that help us to update weights and minimize the loss. * SGD updates gradients after each mini batch, otherwise it will take a lot of time if we decide to update the gradients after going through all the dataset, or the model won’t learn much if we decide to updates the gradients after each data point.\nQ14:\nWhat are the seven steps in SGD for machine learning?\n___\n* Initialize the parameters * Calculate the predictions * Calculate the loss * Calculate the gradients * Step the weights * Redo the whole process from step 2 * Stop\nQ15:\nHow do we initialize the weights in a model?\n___\n* Usually we initialize weights by picking random values\nQ16:\nWhat is “loss”?\n___\n* The loss is function that uses the model in order to optimizes it’s predictions\nQ17:\nWhat’s the gradients?\n___\n* The gradients are values that dictate how much should we change the weights in order to minimize the loss\nQ18:\nWhy can’t we always use a high learning rate?\n___\n* Picking a large learning rate will get the loss worse.\nQ19:\nDo you need to know how to calculate gradients yourself? ___\n* It’s important to understand the math behind each concept in Deep Learning, but we don’t need to do everything by ourself, we could use frameworks like pytorch and fastai.\nQ20:\nWhy can’t we use accuracy as a loss function?\n___\n* Loss function changes as the weights changes, but the accuracy only changes when the predictions change.\nQ21:\nDraw the sigmoid function.

After changing the images size we should fine_tune method.\nWe can look to Progressive Resizing as a form of data augmentation, which mean the model will generalize well.\nTo implement progressive resizing it is most convenient if you first create a get_dls function which takes an image size and a batch size as we did in the section before, and returns your DataLoaders:\nNow you can create your DataLoaders with a small size and use fit_one_cycle in the usual way, training for a few less epochs than you might otherwise do:\n\n\ndls = get_dls(128, 128)\nlearn = Learner(dls, xresnet50(n_out=dls.c), loss_func=CrossEntropyLossFlat(), \n                metrics=accuracy)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(4, 3e-3)\n\n\nThen you can replace the DataLoaders inside the Learner, and fine-tune:\n\n\nlearn.dls = get_dls(64, 224)\nlearn.fine_tune(5, 1e-3)\n\n\nWe can increase the image size by a bit, untill we reach the normal size of the actual image in dataset.\nProgressive resizing can be good or bad depending many factors:\n\nFor transfer learning, if the model is already trained on similar task we will use it for, and on similar size of images, normally re-training it on smaller images will damage the performance.\nIn other hand if the model is trained on dataset with different size of images, and on dfferent task, using progressive resizing may help the model performance.\n\nThere’s no right answear for every situation, we just need to try and experiment different things.\n\n\n\n\n\nTill now all kind of data augmentations we implement are done on training set, while the validation set is taking the same images.\nThe idea behind Test Time Augmentation tta is to use some augmented images for the validation set to get predictions (for the same image) and average (or take the maximun) them.\nUsually fastai do center cropping for validation.\nThis method may cause the model to miss valuable lessons from edges of the cropped images.\nWe could avoid center cropping but instead to select a number of areas to crop from the original rectangular image, pass each of them through our model, then take the average of predictions or the maximum\nBy default, fastai will use the unaugmented center crop image plus four randomly augmented images.\nYou can pass any DataLoader to fastai’s tta method; by default, it will use your validation set:\n\n\npreds,targs = learn.tta()\naccuracy(preds, targs).item()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of mixup is to take two data points (images) and mix them together with some percentage, then do the ine-hot encodings where the new image represented with the new values (percentages) instead of 0 or 1. The model here have to predict not only the right label, but also the percentage by which the label is represented in that image.\nWe can express this idea with code as:\n\n\nchurch = PILImage.create(get_image_files_sorted(path/'train'/'n03028079')[0])\ngas = PILImage.create(get_image_files_sorted(path/'train'/'n03425413')[0])\nchurch = church.resize((256,256))\ngas = gas.resize((256,256))\ntchurch = tensor(church).float() / 255.\ntgas = tensor(gas).float() / 255.\n\n_,axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(12,4))\nshow_image(tchurch, ax=axs[0]);\nshow_image(tgas, ax=axs[1]);\nshow_image((0.3*tchurch + 0.7*tgas), ax=axs[2]);\n\n\nmodel = xresnet50(n_out=dls.c)\nlearn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=CrossEntropyLossFlat(), \n                metrics=accuracy, cbs=MixUp())\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(5, 3e-3)\n\n\nTraining a model with mixup techninx make it way hareder for the model to learn, because the model need to predict 2 labels for each image instead of one, plus predicting the righ percentage of each label.\nOverfitting seems less likely to be a problem when mixup is used.\nMixup tend to produce good results with 80 epochs of training or more.\nOne other benefit of using Mixup is when we have labels == 0, 1, because of using softmax and sigmoid the output can never be 0 or 1, thus our loss can never be perfect. With mixup labels cannot be 0 or 1 unless we mix 2 images with the same label, the rest of the time our labels will be linear combinations like 0.4, 0.6 ..\n\n\n\n\n\nIn classfication problems we usually have labels like 0 and 1, so the model job is to return them accuaratly, even 0.999 is not good enough where the label is 1!. this cuase the model to update the weights in order to get closer and closer to the right and unique answear, what will lead to overfitting.\nThe solution to this problem is to smooth the labels, by replacing 1 with a bit smaller number, and 0 with a bit bigger number. this will encourage the model to be less confident, which will help to better generalization.\nLabel Smoothing can be expressed mathematically:\n\n0: \\(\\frac{\\epsilon}{N}\\) where N is number of classes we have and epsilon represent a parameter usually 0.1(it’s like saying we’re 10% less confident about the label)\n1: \\(1-\\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon}{N}\\)\n\nIn our Imagenette example where we have 10 classes, the targets become something like (here for a target that corresponds to the index 3):\n\n[0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.91, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01]\n\nTo use this in practice, we just have to change the loss function in our call to Learner:\n\n```python model = xresnet50(n_out=dls.c) learn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy(), metrics=accuracy) learn.fit_one_cycle(5, 3e-3)"

    "text": "In classfication problems we usually have labels like 0 and 1, so the model job is to return them accuaratly, even 0.999 is not good enough where the label is 1!. this cuase the model to update the weights in order to get closer and closer to the right and unique answear, what will lead to overfitting.\nThe solution to this problem is to smooth the labels, by replacing 1 with a bit smaller number, and 0 with a bit bigger number. this will encourage the model to be less confident, which will help to better generalization.\nLabel Smoothing can be expressed mathematically:\n\n0: \\(\\frac{\\epsilon}{N}\\) where N is number of classes we have and epsilon represent a parameter usually 0.1(it’s like saying we’re 10% less confident about the label)\n1: \\(1-\\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon}{N}\\)\n\nIn our Imagenette example where we have 10 classes, the targets become something like (here for a target that corresponds to the index 3):\n\n[0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.91, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01]\n\nTo use this in practice, we just have to change the loss function in our call to Learner:\n\n```python model = xresnet50(n_out=dls.c) learn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy(), metrics=accuracy) learn.fit_one_cycle(5, 3e-3)"

/content/gdrive\n\n\n\nfrom fastbook import *\n\n\n\n\nAs we briefly explain, multi-label classfication is when we predict more than category for one image or even zero category.\nIn fact the bear classfier we built earlier is a good example of multi-label calssification , the only exception is that our model doesn’t have the feature of returning zero class if the model isn’t confidently sure about neither of the classes\nIn practice it is more likely to see an images that match more than 1 categories or zero, but it’s rarely to see models being trained for that prorpose.\nFirst, let’s see what a multi-label dataset looks like, then we’ll explain how to get it ready for our model. we’ll see that the architecture of the model does not change from the last chapter; only the loss function does.\n\n\n\n\nFor this chapter we will work with Pascal Dataset which provide multi-label categories per image.\nFirst download the data\n\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.PASCAL_2007)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [1637801984/1637796771 03:06&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nThis dataset is differente from what we’ve seen till now, it’s not structured by filename or folder, instead comes with CSV(Comma-Separated Values) telling us what label is assigned to each image.\n\nwe will use pandas to see analyze the data\n\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv')\ndf\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nfname\nlabels\nis_valid\n\n\n\n\n0\n000005.jpg\nchair\nTrue\n\n\n1\n000007.jpg\ncar\nTrue\n\n\n2\n000009.jpg\nhorse

easiest way is to use DataBlock API.\nBut first we need to define each of these concepts:\n\nDataset: A collection that return a tuple with dependent and independent variales when we index into it ( in this case dataframe)\nDataLoader: An iterator that provides a stream of mini-batches, where each mini-batch is a tuple of a batch of independent variables and a batch of dependent variables\n\nOn the top of these, fastai provides two classes for bringing training and validation set together:\n\nDatasets: a class that contains training dataset and validation dataset\nDataLoaders: a class that contains training DataLoader and validation DataLoader\n\nLet’s create a DataBlock with no parameters, then create Datasets object from in by passing the actual DataFrame we will use df\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock()\n\n\n# create datasets objects\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n\n\nBy default the dataset is randomly splited to train and validation 80%/20%\n\n\nlen(dsets.train), len(dsets.valid)\n\n(4009, 1002)\n\n\n\nIf we call the first item from one of the Datasets it return a row of DataFrame twice, assuming that we have two things: input and target, which we will build later.\n\n\nx, y = dsets.train[0]\nx, y\n\n(fname       008663.jpg\n labels      car person\n is_valid         False\n Name: 4346, dtype: object, fname       008663.jpg\n labels      car person\n is_valid         False\n Name: 4346, dtype: object)\n\n\n\nThe dependent variable is the image name, and the independent variable is the label, so let’s grab them\n\n\nx['fname'], x['labels']\n\n('008663.jpg', 'car person')\n\n\n\nThe goal here is to tell Datablock how identify the x’s and y’s of the dataset.\nWe will use get_x and get_y functions\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock(get_x = lambda r: r['fname'], get_y = lambda r: r['labels'])\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n('005620.jpg', 'aeroplane')\n\n\n\nThe problem with lambdas is cannot be saved when we create a learner, this is why it’s better to avoid them.\n\n\ndef get_x(r): return r['fname']\ndef get_y(r): return r['labels']\ndblock =  DataBlock(get_x= get_x, get_y=get_y)\ndsets= dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n('002549.jpg', 'tvmonitor')\n\n\n\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n\nImage.open(path/'train'/'002549.jpg')\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to open an image we need the path\nAs we know some images has more the one label, that why we need to split them by space.\nLet’s recreate the datablock by adding this 2 things (path, split)\n\n\ndef get_x(r): return path/'train'/r['fname']\ndef get_y(r): return r['labels'].split(' ')\ndblock =  DataBlock(get_x= get_x, get_y=get_y)\ndsets= dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(Path('/root/.fastai/data/pascal_2007/train/002844.jpg'), ['train'])\n\n\n\nNow we can open the image just by calling the [0] of the index of that item in dataset\nTo open image and do the conversion to tensors, we will use block types to provide us with set of transforms: ImageBlock and MultiCategoryBlock\n\nwe used ImageBlock before, it open the image from the path\nbefore we used CategoryBlock which cannot be used here, because it returned a single integer, but here we have multiple labels for each image, thats why we need MultiCategoryBlock\n\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   get_x=get_x,\n                   get_y=get_y)\ndsets= dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=500x375,\n TensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]))\n\n\n\ndsets.train[0][1]\n\nTensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n\n\n\nAs we see the list of categories contains zeros and one 1.\nThe zeros represent all the other categories that doesn’t match the image, and obviously the 1 represent the label\nThis is known as One-Hot Encoding\nLet’s see which category represent this particular image by using toch.where\n\n\nidxs = torch.where(dsets.train[77][1]==1.)[0]\ndsets.train.vocab[idxs]\n\n(#2) ['person','sofa']\n\n\n\nTill we use the randome splitter provided by default, instead of using the is_valid which can be used as splitter\n\n\ndf.is_valid\n\n0        True\n1        True\n2        True\n3       False\n4        True\n        ...  \n5006     True\n5007     True\n5008     True\n5009    False\n5010    False\nName: is_valid, Length: 5011, dtype: bool\n\n\n\ndef splitter(df):\n    train = df.index[~df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    valid = df.index[df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    return train,valid\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x,\n                   get_y=get_y)\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=500x333,\n TensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]))\n\n\n\nlen(dsets.train), len(dsets.valid)\n\n(2501, 2510)\n\n\n\nOne last we have to do before creating our dataloaders, is to make sure that all images are the same size by using RandomResizeCrop\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x, \n                   get_y=get_y,\n                   item_tfms = RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.35))\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(df)\n\n\ndls.show_batch(nrows=2, ncols=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to create a Learner, we know that learner is defined by 4 things:\n\nmodel (resenet18)\ndataloaders, we already created it\nOptimizer (SGD)\nloss-function: we need to make sure that we create a suitable loss function for this type of model.First we create a learner and look at its activations\n\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:209: UserWarning: The parameter

The details of this aren’t important for our purposes, so we’ll just show the function we use to extract the head center point:\n\n\ncal = np.genfromtxt(path/'01'/'rgb.cal', skip_footer=6)\ndef get_ctr(f):\n    ctr = np.genfromtxt(img2pose(f), skip_header=3)\n    c1 = ctr[0] * cal[0][0]/ctr[2] + cal[0][2]\n    c2 = ctr[1] * cal[1][1]/ctr[2] + cal[1][2]\n    return tensor([c1,c2])\n\n\nThis function return the coordinate of the center of the head of each image, so we can pass it as the get_y to DataBlock since it represent the independent variable for each image\n\n\nget_ctr(img_files[0])\n\ntensor([343.6303, 276.7759])\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains images of many person, each one has multiple images, so we can’t just randomly split the dataset, because we need the model to generelize on new people/images, and training the model on image of a person, and validate the results on a training set that contains images of the same person, will definitively cause Overfitting\nInstead what we do in this case, is to take all images that belong to one person, and define them as validation set.\n\n\nbiwi = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, PointBlock),\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    get_y=get_ctr,\n    splitter=FuncSplitter(lambda o: o.parent.name=='13'),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=(240,320)))\n\n\nAs we see here we use PointBlock, this is what fastai use to coordinate data (tensor with 2 values)\nFor the splitting as we said before we took one person’s images 13 and put the all into validation dataset.\nWe use aug_transforms as transformers\nBefore doing any modeling, we should look at our data to confirm it seems okay:\n\n\ndls = biwi.dataloaders(path)\ndls.show_batch(max_n=9, figsize=(8,6))\n\n\n\n\n\nxb, yb= dls.one_batch()\nxb.shape, yb.shape\n\n(torch.Size([64, 3, 240, 320]), torch.Size([64, 1, 2]))\n\n\n\nxb shape is [64,3,240,320]:\n\n64 is the number of items in each mini-batch\n3 represent number of channels, which in this case colors\n240*320 are the pixels of the image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create learner with help of vision_learner we pass to it:\n\ndls\nresnet18\ny_range(): this function define the range of our targets.

    "text": "As we briefly explain, multi-label classfication is when we predict more than category for one image or even zero category.\nIn fact the bear classfier we built earlier is a good example of multi-label calssification , the only exception is that our model doesn’t have the feature of returning zero class if the model isn’t confidently sure about neither of the classes\nIn practice it is more likely to see an images that match more than 1 categories or zero, but it’s rarely to see models being trained for that prorpose.\nFirst, let’s see what a multi-label dataset looks like, then we’ll explain how to get it ready for our model. we’ll see that the architecture of the model does not change from the last chapter; only the loss function does.\n\n\n\n\nFor this chapter we will work with Pascal Dataset which provide multi-label categories per image.\nFirst download the data\n\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.PASCAL_2007)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n

easiest way is to use DataBlock API.\nBut first we need to define each of these concepts:\n\nDataset: A collection that return a tuple with dependent and independent variales when we index into it ( in this case dataframe)\nDataLoader: An iterator that provides a stream of mini-batches, where each mini-batch is a tuple of a batch of independent variables and a batch of dependent variables\n\nOn the top of these, fastai provides two classes for bringing training and validation set together:\n\nDatasets: a class that contains training dataset and validation dataset\nDataLoaders: a class that contains training DataLoader and validation DataLoader\n\nLet’s create a DataBlock with no parameters, then create Datasets object from in by passing the actual DataFrame we will use df\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock()\n\n\n# create datasets objects\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n\n\nBy default the dataset is randomly splited to train and validation 80%/20%\n\n\nlen(dsets.train), len(dsets.valid)\n\n(4009, 1002)\n\n\n\nIf we call the first item from one of the Datasets it return a row of DataFrame twice, assuming that we have two things: input and target, which we will build later.\n\n\nx, y = dsets.train[0]\nx, y\n\n(fname       008663.jpg\n labels      car person\n is_valid         False\n Name: 4346, dtype: object, fname       008663.jpg\n labels      car person\n is_valid         False\n Name: 4346, dtype: object)\n\n\n\nThe dependent variable is the image name, and the independent variable is the label, so let’s grab them\n\n\nx['fname'], x['labels']\n\n('008663.jpg', 'car person')\n\n\n\nThe goal here is to tell Datablock how identify the x’s and y’s of the dataset.\nWe will use get_x and get_y functions\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock(get_x = lambda r: r['fname'], get_y = lambda r: r['labels'])\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n('005620.jpg', 'aeroplane')\n\n\n\nThe problem with lambdas is cannot be saved when we create a learner, this is why it’s better to avoid them.\n\n\ndef get_x(r): return r['fname']\ndef get_y(r): return r['labels']\ndblock =  DataBlock(get_x= get_x, get_y=get_y)\ndsets= dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n('002549.jpg', 'tvmonitor')\n\n\n\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n\nImage.open(path/'train'/'002549.jpg')\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to open an image we need the path\nAs we know some images has more the one label, that why we need to split them by space.\nLet’s recreate the datablock by adding this 2 things (path, split)\n\n\ndef get_x(r): return path/'train'/r['fname']\ndef get_y(r): return r['labels'].split(' ')\ndblock =  DataBlock(get_x= get_x, get_y=get_y)\ndsets= dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(Path('/root/.fastai/data/pascal_2007/train/002844.jpg'), ['train'])\n\n\n\nNow we can open the image just by calling the [0] of the index of that item in dataset\nTo open image and do the conversion to tensors, we will use block types to provide us with set of transforms: ImageBlock and MultiCategoryBlock\n\nwe used ImageBlock before, it open the image from the path\nbefore we used CategoryBlock which cannot be used here, because it returned a single integer, but here we have multiple labels for each image, thats why we need MultiCategoryBlock\n\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   get_x=get_x,\n                   get_y=get_y)\ndsets= dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=500x375,\n TensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]))\n\n\n\ndsets.train[0][1]\n\nTensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n\n\n\nAs we see the list of categories contains zeros and one 1.\nThe zeros represent all the other categories that doesn’t match the image, and obviously the 1 represent the label\nThis is known as One-Hot Encoding\nLet’s see which category represent this particular image by using toch.where\n\n\nidxs = torch.where(dsets.train[77][1]==1.)[0]\ndsets.train.vocab[idxs]\n\n(#2) ['person','sofa']\n\n\n\nTill we use the randome splitter provided by default, instead of using the is_valid which can be used as splitter\n\n\ndf.is_valid\n\n0        True\n1        True\n2        True\n3       False\n4        True\n        ...  \n5006     True\n5007     True\n5008     True\n5009    False\n5010    False\nName: is_valid, Length: 5011, dtype: bool\n\n\n\ndef splitter(df):\n    train = df.index[~df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    valid = df.index[df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    return train,valid\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x,\n                   get_y=get_y)\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=500x333,\n TensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]))\n\n\n\nlen(dsets.train), len(dsets.valid)\n\n(2501, 2510)\n\n\n\nOne last we have to do before creating our dataloaders, is to make sure that all images are the same size by using RandomResizeCrop\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x, \n                   get_y=get_y,\n                   item_tfms = RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.35))\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(df)\n\n\ndls.show_batch(nrows=2, ncols=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to create a Learner, we know that learner is defined by 4 things:\n\nmodel (resenet18)\ndataloaders, we already created it\nOptimizer (SGD)\nloss-function: we need to make sure that we create a suitable loss function for this type of model.First we create a learner and look at its activations\n\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:209: UserWarning: The parameter

We’ll begin by downloading the dataset as usual:\n\n\npath = untar_data(URLs.BIWI_HEAD_POSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [452321280/452316199 00:36&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nPath.BASE_PATH = path\n\n\npath.ls().sorted()\n\n(#50) [Path('01'),Path('01.obj'),Path('02'),Path('02.obj'),Path('03'),Path('03.obj'),Path('04'),Path('04.obj'),Path('05'),Path('05.obj')...]\n\n\n\nThere are 24 directories numbered from 01 to 24 (they correspond to the different people photographed), and a corresponding .obj file for each (we won’t need them here). Let’s take a look inside one of these directories:\n\n\n(path/'01').ls().sorted()\n\n(#1000) [Path('01/depth.cal'),Path('01/frame_00003_pose.txt'),Path('01/frame_00003_rgb.jpg'),Path('01/frame_00004_pose.txt'),Path('01/frame_00004_rgb.jpg'),Path('01/frame_00005_pose.txt'),Path('01/frame_00005_rgb.jpg'),Path('01/frame_00006_pose.txt'),Path('01/frame_00006_rgb.jpg'),Path('01/frame_00007_pose.txt')...]\n\n\n\nInside the subdirectories, we have different frames, each of them come with an image (_rgb.jpg) and a pose file (_pose.txt). We can easily get all the image files recursively with get_image_files, then write a function that converts an image filename to its associated pose file:\n\n\nimg_files = get_image_files(path)\ndef img2pose(x): return Path(f'{str(x)[:-7]}pose.txt')\nimg2pose(img_files[0])\n\nPath('20/frame_00388_pose.txt')\n\n\n\nim = PILImage.create(img_files[0])\nim.shape\n\n(480, 640)\n\n\n\nim.to_thumb(250)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Biwi dataset website used to explain the format of the pose text file associated with each image, which shows the location of the center of the head. The details of this aren’t important for our purposes, so we’ll just show the function we use to extract the head center point:\n\n\ncal = np.genfromtxt(path/'01'/'rgb.cal', skip_footer=6)\ndef get_ctr(f):\n    ctr = np.genfromtxt(img2pose(f), skip_header=3)\n    c1 = ctr[0] * cal[0][0]/ctr[2] + cal[0][2]\n    c2 = ctr[1] * cal[1][1]/ctr[2] + cal[1][2]\n    return tensor([c1,c2])\n\n\nThis function return the coordinate of the center of the head of each image, so we can pass it as the get_y to DataBlock since it represent the independent variable for each image\n\n\nget_ctr(img_files[0])\n\ntensor([343.6303, 276.7759])\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains images of many person, each one has multiple images, so we can’t just randomly split the dataset, because we need the model to generelize on new people/images, and training the model on image of a person, and validate the results on a training set that contains images of the same person, will definitively cause Overfitting\nInstead what we do in this case, is to take all images that belong to one person, and define them as validation set.\n\n\nbiwi = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, PointBlock),\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    get_y=get_ctr,\n    splitter=FuncSplitter(lambda o: o.parent.name=='13'),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=(240,320)))\n\n\nAs we see here we use PointBlock, this is what fastai use to coordinate data (tensor with 2 values)\nFor the splitting as we said before we took one person’s images 13 and put the all into validation dataset.\nWe use aug_transforms as transformers\nBefore doing any modeling, we should look at our data to confirm it seems okay:\n\n\ndls = biwi.dataloaders(path)\ndls.show_batch(max_n=9, figsize=(8,6))\n\n\n\n\n\nxb, yb= dls.one_batch()\nxb.shape, yb.shape\n\n(torch.Size([64, 3, 240, 320]), torch.Size([64, 1, 2]))\n\n\n\nxb shape is [64,3,240,320]:\n\n64 is the number of items in each mini-batch\n3 represent number of channels, which in this case colors\n240*320 are the pixels of the image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create learner with help of vision_learner we pass to it:\n\ndls\nresnet18\ny_range(): this function define the range of our targets. In fastai this function is implemented using the sigmoid_range\n\n\n\ndef sigmoid_range(x, lo, hi): return torch.sigmoid(x) * (hi-lo) + lo\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, y_range=(-1,1))\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:209: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15, please use 'weights' instead.\n  f\"The parameter '{pretrained_param}' is deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15, \"\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15.

    "text": "Q1:\nHow could multi-label classification improve the usability of the bear classifier?\nMulti-label classfication gives the models in production the ability to return 0 prediction if the user inputs an image that doesn't contains any of the classes we trained the model to predict. In the case of bear classification inference, if we upload an image that doesn't contains any bear, our model still predict  a class.\nQ2:\nHow do we encode the dependent variable in a multi-label classification problem?\nIn multi-label classification we use One-Hot encoders, which is represented as an list with zeros and ones, where one(s) represent the label of that particular image.\nQ3:\nHow do you access the rows and columns of a DataFrame as if it was a matrix?\nWe could use .iloc or loc to access any row or colum of a DataFrame\nQ4:\nHow do you get a column by name from a DataFrame?\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndic = {'col1':[1, 2, 3], 'col2':[4, 5, 6]}\n\n\ndf =  pd.DataFrame(dic)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol1\ncol2\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n4\n\n\n1\n2\n5\n\n\n2\n3\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# access column by name:\ndf.col1\n\n0    1\n1    2\n2    3\nName: col1, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n# or this way\ndf['col2']\n\n0    4\n1    5\n2    6\nName: col2, dtype: int64\n\n\nQ5:\nWhat is the difference between a Dataset and DataLoader?\nDataset could be any collection the return a tuple with dependent and independent variables when we index to it (DataFrame in our case)\nDataLoader is an iterator that provide the stream of mini batch, shuffling the datapoints..\nQ6:\nWhat does a Datasets object normally contain?\nDatasets objects contains Training Dataset and Validation Dataset\nQ7:\nWhat does a DataLoaders object normally contain?\nDataloaders contains training DataLoader and Validation DataLoader\nQ8:\nWhat does lambda do in Python?\nIt provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions\nQ9:\nWhat are the methods to customize how the independent and dependent variables are created with the data block API?\nWe could use functions to customize how to define the independent and dependent variable, then assign these functions to get_x and get_y \nQ10:\nWhy is softmax not an appropriate output activation function when using a one hot encoded target?\nSoftmax pushes the model to pick one class among others, while when using one-hot encoding with multi-label classification we have more the one class per image.\nQ12:\nWhat is the difference between nn.BCELoss and nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss?\nnn.BCELoss has no sigmoid while nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss includes sigmoid in it.\nQ13:\nWhen is it okay to tune a hyperparameter on the validation set?\nWhen the results seems to have a smooth curve, what indicates the results change  based on changes to the hyper-parameters.\nQ14:\nHow is y_range implemented in fastai?\nfunction define the range of our targets. In fastai this function is implemented using the `sigmoid_range`\nQ16:\nWhat is a regression problem? What loss function should you use for such a problem?\nRegression problem is where we have to predict a continous value.\nUsually in this kind of problem the mean squared error is used\nQ17:\nWhat do you need to do to make sure the fastai library applies the same data augmentation to your input images and your target point coordinates?\nThe PointBlock class needs to be passed to the blocks parameter."

    "text": "Q1:\nWhat is the difference between ImageNet and Imagenette? When is it better to experiment on one versus the other?\n* ImageNet is dataset with 1.3 million images and 1000 gategories, while Imagenette is a dataset that represent a small portion of ImageNet with 10 classes. * For studying/devloping ideas/ prototyping we better use a small dataset.\nQ2:\nWhat is normalization?\n* Normalization is a method that get the mean close to 0, and the standar diviation clos to 1 (ideally mean==0, std==1)\nQ3:\nWhy didn’t we have to care about normalization when using a pretrained model?\n* Using pretrained models through vision_learner set the Normalization method automatically.\nQ4:\nWhat is progressive resizing?\n* Progressive resizing is the idea of using small images in the earlier epochs of training phase, then changing the size of the images by a bit and fine tune the model for more epochs, repeat this process till we reach the original size of the image from the dataset.\nQ5:\nWhat is test time augmentation? How do you use it in fastai?\n* Validation set by default uses centre crop for images, which will leads to information lost, TTA addresses this problem by cropping from multiple areas of the image and calculate the predictions of all this crops, then take the average(or the max). preds,targs = learn.tta()\naccuracy(preds, targs).item()\nQ6:\nIs using TTA at inference slower or faster than regular inference? Why?\n* It will take more time than regular inference, because the model calculate the prediction of an image more than once.\nQ7:\nWhat is Mixup? How do you use it in fastai?\n* It’s a data augmenatation method that takes 2 images and mix them together. In fastai mixup used as callback : cbs=Mixup()\nQ10:\nWhat is the idea behind label smoothing?\n* It’s a technique that change the one-hot-encodings value from 0 and 1 to float values, this reduce the overfitting and produce better performance.\nQ11:\nWhen using label smoothing with five categories, what is the target associated with the index 1?\n\nlabels = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nparam = 0.1\n\ndef label_smoothing(labels, param):\n    new_labels = []\n    for label in labels:\n        if label == 1:\n            new_label = 1 - param + param / len(labels)\n            new_labels.append(new_label)\n        else:\n            new_label = param / len(labels)\n            new_labels.append(new_label)\n    return new_labels\n\nlabel_smoothing(labels, param)\n\n[0.02, 0.92, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02]\n\n\nQ12:\nWhat is the first step to take when you want to prototype quick experiments on a new dataset?\n* First do the protoype and experiments, if it takes more than couple of minutes, then we need to consider new subset of that dataset."

    "text": "Deep Learning In Production\nWhen we create a model that met our objectives, we can then pass to the Production phase, where we transform the model into an appliction/service etc..\nBut first we need to export the model into a file:\n\nlearn.export()\n\nLet’s check that the file exists, by using the ls method that fastai adds to Python’s Path class:\n\npath = Path()\npath.ls(file_exts='.pkl')\n\n(#1) [Path('export.pkl')]\n\n\n\nNow with the export.pkl file we can create normal program that takes inputs(images) and produce results (predictions) just like any traditional app\nAt this point we won’t call it a model anymore, we call it inference.\n\n &gt;Using the trained model as program\nThe export() function allow us to save the model in oreder to use it later, and as we know model is Architecture + Parameters, Fastai by default saves also the method of which we’ve created the DataLoaders, because otherwise we have to define it again in order to work with the new data we will feed to the model.\n\nFrom Model to Inference\nThis file export.pkl is allways needed wherever we will create an app from it, for now we will use it whithin this notebook in order to create a small app that can predict bears type from image we will provide.\nWhen we use a model for getting predictions, instead of training, we call it inference.\nTo create inference learner from export.pkl file we use load_learner:\n\nlearn_inf = load_learner(path/'export.pkl')\n\n\n# predicting one image\nlearn_inf.predict('images/bear.jpg')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n('grizzly', TensorBase(1), TensorBase([8.0130e-07, 1.0000e+00, 2.0153e-07]))\n\n\n\nThis has returned three things:\n\nthe predicted category(label) in the same format we originally provided (in this case that’s a string),\nthe index of the predicted category, and the probabilities of each category.\nthe last two are based on the order of categories in the vocab of the DataLoaders; that is, the stored list of all possible categories.\n\nAt inference time, you can access the DataLoaders as an attribute of the Learner:\n\n\nlearn_inf.dls.vocab\n\n['black', 'grizzly', 'teddy']\n\n\nWe can see here that if we index into the vocab with the integer returned by predict then we get back “grizzly,” as expected. Also, note that if we index into the list of probabilities, we see a nearly 1.00 probability that this is a grizzly.\n\n\nGradio + HugginFace Spaces\n\nIf we want to share our model with a broader audience, and showcase our skills we need to create a real app that can be used outside of the datascience/machine learning word where nobody know or have the ability to use jupyter notebook or python.. and that’s why we will show using a combination of python package Gradio that will allow us to build our app, then host it on HuggingFace\n\n\n# firstly install gradio\n!pip install

Thanks to broadcasting, we can also test it on the full validation set of 3s:\n\n\nis_3(valid_ten_3)\n\ntensor([True, True, True,  ..., True, True, True])\n\n\n\nNow we can calculate the accuracy for each of the 3s and 7s by taking the average of that function for all 3s and its inverse for all 7s:\n\n\naccuracy_3s =      is_3(valid_ten_3).float() .mean()\naccuracy_7s = (1 - is_3(valid_ten_7).float()).mean()\n\naccuracy_3s,accuracy_7s,(accuracy_3s+accuracy_7s)/2\n\n(tensor(0.9168), tensor(0.9854), tensor(0.9511))\n\n\n\nWe’re getting +90% accuracy just by doing base-line model!!\nThe base-Line model is good for understanding the problem and building the intuition, but we didn’t build a deep learning model yet.\n\nwe did not add the Learning fase to our model, which is a crucial part according to Arthur Samuel definition\n\nIn other words, this model cannot be updated and improved by learning\n\nwe can’t improve pixel similarity approach by modifying set of parameters, because we don’t have one! and that’s why we need SGD"

    "text": "Stochastic Gradient Descent\n\nInstead of trying to find similarity between an image and the “ideal image” we could add set of weights to each pixel, such as the heighest are associated with darker pixel and lowest are more likely to be white.\n\nfor example the pixel bottom right are white in 7s, so we will give them low weights\n\nThis can be represented as a function and set of weight values for each possible digit:\ndef pr_eight(x,w): return (x*w).sum()\n\nx is the image we’re predicting which will be represented as vector\nw is the weights of the image, also vector\n\nThe idea to find a method by which we update the weights, such as it can help us to make to predict better by a bit, then repeat those steps many times til we get the best prediction we can get.\n\nfind the specific values for the vector w that causes the result of our function to be high for those images that are actually 8s, and low for those images that are not.\n\nHere are the steps that we are going to require, to turn this function into a machine learning classifier:\n\n\nInitialize the weights.\n\n\nFor each image, use these weights to predict whether it appears to be a 3 or a 7.\n\n\nBased on these predictions, calculate how good the model is (its loss).\n\n\nCalculate the gradient, which measures for each weight, how changing that weight would change the loss\n\n\nStep (that is, change) all the weights based on that calculation.\n\n\nGo back to the step 2, and repeat the process.\n\n\nIterate until you decide to stop the training process (for instance, because the model is good enough or you don’t want to wait any longer). \n\n\n\n\nApllying SGD on a simple case\n\nBefore applying these steps to our image classification problem, let’s illustrate what they look like in a simpler case.\nFirst we will define a very simple function f, the quadratic—let’s pretend that this is our loss function, and x is a weight parameter of the function:\n\n\ndef f(x): return x**2\n\n\nplot_function(f, 'x', 'x**2')\n\n\n\n\nLet’s pick a rondom value for the paramter, and calculating the loss\n\nplot_function(f, 'x', 'x**2')\nplt.scatter(-1.5, f(-1.5), color='red');\n\n\n\n\n\nnow we will increase/decrease the parameter value by just a bit(0.5)and see what will happen:\n\n\nplot_function(f,'x','x**2')\nplt.scatter(-1.5, f(-1.5), color='red' );\nplt.scatter(-1,f(-1), color='blue');\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seem that our loss get better(remember, the whole objective of this process is to minimize the loss to 0), we better keep increase the paramter but this time by (0.3), then(0.3):\n\n\nplot_function(f,'x','x**2')\nplt.scatter(-1.5, f(-1.5), color='red' );\nplt.scatter(-1,f(-1), color='blue');\nplt.scatter(-0.7,f(-0.7), color='green');\nplt.scatter(-0.5, f(-0.5), color='orange');\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main idea here is to adjust the paramters in a way that causes a minimal loss \nWe can change our weight by a little in the direction of the slope, calculate our loss and adjustment again, and repeat this a few times. Eventually, we will get to the lowest point on our curve:\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2022-09-13 at 14-25-28 04_mnist_basics - Jupyter Notebook.png\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Gradients\n\nIt’s obvious now that in order to optimize the loss function we need to update the weights.\n\nto do that we need the help of calculus, it will allow us to update the weights in the direction that optimize the loss\n\n\n\n\nCalculating derivative on Pytorch\n\n#let's assume this variable\ndef f(x): return x**2\nxt = tensor(3.).requires_grad_()\n\n\nhere we create a tensor at value 3 the we call the method requires_grad_ which will calculate the gradients in respect to that variable at that value.\n\n\n# add the function f(x)=x**2 as a Y\nyt = f(xt)\nyt\n\ntensor(9., grad_fn=&lt;PowBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\n# now we calculate the gradients using the backward() \nyt.backward()\n\n\n#now we can views the gradients by checking the `grad` attribute of the tensor:\nxt.grad\n\ntensor(6.)\n\n\n\n#now we will repeat the same steps but now with a vector:\nxt = tensor([3.,4.,10.]).requires_grad_()\n\n\ndef f(x): return (x**2).sum()\n\n\n#let's check our function\nf(xt)\n\ntensor(125., grad_fn=&lt;SumBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nyt = f(xt)\n\n\n#calculate the gradients\nyt.backward()\n\n\n#as expected 2xt\nxt.grad\n\ntensor([ 6.,  8., 20.])\n\n\n\n#let's create another example\nx= tensor(3.).requires_grad_()\nw= tensor(4.).requires_grad_()\nb= tensor(5.).requires_grad_()\ny = x * w + b\ny\n\ntensor(17.,

tensor(1.)\n\n\n\nNow we have all the ingredients to apply what we have learned on a real problem.\n\nthe goal here is to apply these 7 steps we saw in order to optimize the weights which will effect the loss, which also effect the accuracy of the model\n\none last thing before we do that, we will talk about Learnin rate\nGradient descent allow us to correct our weights by taking steps toward the optimal value of these weights, but it didn’t tell us how big or small these steps are, thats why we have to initilize a learning rate.\nLearning rate is a value, by which our gradient calculate new weights in order to get better loss.\nIn general the learning rate is some randome value we chase between 0.1 and 0.001\nOnce we have picked a learning rate we then adjust the parameters using this simple function:\n\nw-=gradient(w)*lr\n\n\nAn End-to-End SGD Example\n\nSuppose we want to predict the speed of a Roller Coaster over a hump.\nWe want to build a model that predict how the speed change over time\n\nwe measure the speed of the 20 seconds manualy/ every second:\n\n\n\ntime = torch.arange(20).float();\ntime\n\ntensor([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.,  9., 10., 11., 12., 13., 14., 15., 16., 17., 18., 19.])\n\n\n\nIt might look something like this:\n\n\n# we add some noise to the data since this is the way we usualy find data in real world\nspeed = torch.randn(20)*3 + 0.75*(time-9.5)**2 + 1\nplt.scatter(time,speed);\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal here is to find a function that matches our observastions using SGD\nWe chose here a quadratic function!.\n\nwe need to distinguish clearly between the input of the function t (the that’s the product of our observation) and it’s parameters params\n\n\n\n#let's just assume this  quadratic function!!!\n\ndef f(t, params):\n    a, b, c= params\n    return a*(t**2)+(b*t)+c\n\n\nThe we need to set a loss function that will tell us how good or bad our prediction of the parameters a, b, c\n\n\ndef mse(preds, targets): return((preds - targets)**2).mean().sqrt()\n\n\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n\nfirst we need to initialize the parametrs by telling pytorch that we want to track its gradients\n\n\nparams= torch.randn(3).requires_grad_()\nparams\n\ntensor([-0.7658, -0.7506,  1.3525], requires_grad=True)\n\n\n\n#??\norig_params = params.clone()\n\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate the predictions\n\nNext we calculate the prediction\n\n\npreds = f(time, params)\npreds\n\ntensor([ 1.3525e+00, -1.6391e-01, -3.2121e+00, -7.7919e+00, -1.3903e+01, -2.1547e+01, -3.0721e+01, -4.1428e+01, -5.3666e+01, -6.7436e+01, -8.2738e+01, -9.9571e+01, -1.1794e+02, -1.3783e+02,\n        -1.5926e+02, -1.8222e+02, -2.0671e+02, -2.3274e+02, -2.6029e+02, -2.8938e+02], grad_fn=&lt;AddBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nThe pred here are the function we create earlier. * f(t, params): am bm c= params return a*(t**2)+(b*t)+c - where the t==time, and params are the initialized values we took in the step before, so the f will be calculated by taking those values as a part of it\n\n# plot the actual calues and our prediction \ndef show_preds(preds, ax=None):\n    if ax is None: ax=plt.subplots()[1]\n    ax.scatter(time, speed)\n    ax.scatter(time, to_np(preds), color='red')\n    ax.set_ylim(-300,100)\n\n\nshow_preds(preds)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue dot represent the actal value\nThe red dots represent what our model\n\npredictions are really bad, but we need to remember that these prediction are based on Random Values\n\nSo our job here is to update these values to get better predictions\n\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate the loss\n\nWe calculate now the loss of our prediction\nRemember:\n\ndef mse(preds, targets): return((preds - targets)**2).mean().sqrt()\n\nloss= mse(preds, speed)\nloss\n\ntensor(160.6979, grad_fn=&lt;SqrtBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nOur goal is to improve this loss function by minimizing it, to be as close as possible to the target(speed)\n\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate the gradients\n\nIn order to minimize the loss function we use the gradients to aproximate how the parameters can be changed to achieve our goal\n\n\nloss.backward()\nparams.grad\n\ntensor([-165.5151,  -10.6402,   -0.7900])\n\n\n\nparams.grad\n\ntensor([-165.5151,  -10.6402,   -0.7900])\n\n\n\nparams\n\ntensor([-0.7658, -0.7506,  1.3525], requires_grad=True)\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Step the weights\n\nWe need to updated the weights(paramaters) we just calculated\n\nfirst we need to fix the learning rate\nthen we need to call .data on the parameters and parameters.grad, it’s like telling pytorch to not track the change in the gradients at this point.\n\n\n\nlr = 1e-5\nparams.data -= lr * params.grad.data\nparams.grad = None\n\n\nLet’s see if the loss has improved:\n\n\npreds = f(time,params)\nmse(preds, speed)\n\ntensor(160.4228, grad_fn=&lt;SqrtBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nwhat’s about the plot\n\n\nshow_preds(preds)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s execute all steps in one function\n\n\ndef apply_step(params, prn=True):\n    preds = f(time, params)\n    loss = mse(preds, speed)\n    loss.backward()\n    params.data -= lr * params.grad.data\n

    "text": "The MNIST Loss Function\n\nWe saw previously the function pr_eights() where we represent the input images x as vector, just like the w weight vector.\n\nhere we will do the same with our MNIST_sample\n\nWe already have our dataset for 3s and 7s as tensors == the x of the function:\n\ntraining-set: stacked_threes, stacked_sevens\nvalidation-set : valid_ten_3, valid_ten_7\n\nWe’ll concatenate them all into a single tensor, and also change them from a list of matrices (a rank-3 tensor) to a list of vectors (a rank-2 tensor)\n\nby using .view\nwhich is a Pytorh method that changes the shape of a tensor without changing its content\n-1 is a special parameter to .view that mean: make this axis as big as necessary to fit the data\n\n\n\ntrain_x = torch.cat([stacked_threes, stacked_sevens]).view(-1, 28*28)\n\n\ntrain_x.shape\n\ntorch.Size([12396, 784])\n\n\n\nWe need a label for each image. We’ll use 1 for 3s and 0 for 7s:\n\n\ntrain_y = tensor([1]*len(threes) + [0]*len(sevens))\ntrain_x.shape,train_y.shape\n\n(torch.Size([12396, 784]), torch.Size([12396]))\n\n\n\nThe problem here is that train_x and train_y don’t match in terms of shape.\nHere we will use unsqueeze() method to train_y which will return rank 2 tensor: \n\n\ntrain_y= train_y.unsqueeze(1)\ntrain_y.shape\n\ntorch.Size([12396, 1])\n\n\n\nHere we create dset dataset for training by ziping both dependent and independent variables.\n\n\ndset = list(zip(train_x,train_y))\nx,y = dset[0]\nx.shape,y\n\n(torch.Size([784]), tensor([1]))\n\n\n\nGo through the same steps for validation set\n\n\nvalid_x = torch.cat([valid_ten_3, valid_ten_7]).view(-1, 28*28)\nvalid_y = tensor([1]*len(valid_ten_3) + [0]*len(valid_ten_7)).unsqueeze(1)\nvalid_dset = list(zip(valid_x,valid_y))\n\nNow we begin the 7 steps we saw earlier but now for the mnist model\n### 1-INIT the parameters\n\ndef init_params(size, std=1.0): return (torch.randn(size)*std).requires_grad_()\n\n\nInitialize weights\n\n\nweights = init_params((28*28, 1))\nweights.shape\n\ntorch.Size([784, 1])\n\n\n\nInitialize the bias\n\n\nbias = init_params(1)\nbias\n\ntensor([0.6863], requires_grad=True)\n\n\n\n2-Prediction calculation\n\nNow we can calculate the prediction based on those randome weights and biases for one image[0]\nIn order to multiply 2 matrix you need to make sure they have same number of inner product:\n\nnumber of columns first matrix==number of rows second matrix\n\n\n\n(train_x[0]*weights.T).sum()+bias\n\ntensor([20.2336], grad_fn=&lt;AddBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nIn python matrix multiplication is represented by @\nHere we create a function that return our training set as matrix multiplied @ by weights then added to the bias radome value\n\n\ndef linear1(xb): return xb@weights + bias\npreds = linear1(train_x)\npreds\n\ntensor([[20.2336],\n        [17.0644],\n        [15.2384],\n        ...,\n        [18.3804],\n        [23.8567],\n        [28.6816]], grad_fn=&lt;AddBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nCheck the accuracy of our modl based on random weights\n\n\n# Let's check our accuracy\ncorrects = (preds&gt;0.0).float()==train_y\ncorrects\n\ntensor([[ True],\n        [ True],\n        [ True],\n        ...,\n        [False],\n        [False],\n        [False]])\n\n\n\n# check the mean\ncorrects.float().mean().item()\n\n0.4912068545818329\n\n\n\nNow let’s see what the change in accuracy is for a small change in one of the weights (note that we have to ask PyTorch not to calculate gradients as we do this, which is what with torch.no_grad() is doing here):\n\n\nwith torch.no_grad(): weights[0] *= 1.0001\n\n\npreds = linear1(train_x)\n((preds&gt;0.0).float() == train_y).float().mean().item()\n\n0.4912068545818329\n\n\n\nAs we notice even with the change we commited in one of the weights we didn’t observe any change at all in the model accuracy! which rise a problem for our method. we need a formula that can reflexes the changes we commited to the parameters, so we update the parameters in a way that make our predictions better.\nThe problem with the thresh preds&gt;0.0 is that the gradients are allways equal to zero, because as we know the gradients are calculate as rise over run, and in this case the small change in parameters is rarely could change the prediction from 3 to 7 or vice-versa, so the gradients will allways indicate to 0.\n\nInstead we need a loss function, which when our weights results a slightly better prediction, gives us a slightly better loss function\n\n\ntrgts  = tensor([1,0,1])\nprds   = tensor([0.9, 0.4, 0.2])\n\n\nHere we assume that the trgts is the image we want to predict, 1 for 3’s and 0 for 7’s,\nSo in this case the model is confident in the first image it’s a 3 with 0.9, and not sure about the second image with 0.4, and way too incorrect in the 3d image with 0.2\nThe objective is to build a loss function that will calculate the accuracy of the model and returns some metrics that will be updated if we update our parameters\n\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n    return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\n\ntorch.where is a way of puting specific condition, in other way we can say this:\n\nif targets==1: loss = 1-predictions else: targets==0\n\ntorch.where(trgts==1, 1-prds, prds).mean()\n\ntensor(0.4333)\n\n\n\nSee if the loss will be updated if we change the weights.\n\nwe will pass this tensor [0.9, 0.4, 0.8] and see how to change the prediction from 0.2 to 0.8 will efects the loss function\n\n\n\nmnist_loss(tensor([0.9, 0.4, 0.8]), trgts)\n\ntensor(0.2333)\n\n\n\nAs we see here the loss function gets better when we minimize the distance between the prediction and the target in the third image\n\nThe problem that we still face in this method is that we assume that the predictions will allways be between 0 and 1\nTo solve this problem we need a function that return any prediction how matter bigger that 1 or smaller than 0 to the interval between those 2 numbers\nIn fact there’s a function that do the same exact thing, we call it SIGMOID FUNCTION\n\n\n\nSigmoid Function\nThe sigmoid function always outputs a number between 0 and 1. It’s defined as follows:\n\ndef sigmoid(x): return 1/(1+torch.exp(-x))\n\n\nplot_function(torch.sigmoid, title='Sigmoid', min=-4, max=4)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever input we give it to Sigmoid it will always return a number between 0 and 1\nNow let’s update the mnist_loss by adding sigmoid to its inputs\n\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n    predictions = predictions.sigmoid()\n    return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\n\n\nSGD and Mini-Batches\n\nNow we have our loss function for the SGD, we need to know which method we will take in order to update the gradients, we can update them after taking all the data points or after calculating each data points.\nThe first method will take a lot of time, and the second will not use much information, so we will take another track which is to use Mini-Batches and update the gradients after one mini-batch\nHow many datapoints in each batch is called batch-size. a larger batch size will produce more accurate result but it will take much time, and smaller batch-size will need many epochs to learn but it will be faster\nWe will see later how to decide the suitable batch-size for each situation\nWe will use DataLoader in order to shuffle data items before we create the mini-batches, so we vary the data items in each of the mini batches\n\n\n#for example\nc = range(15)\ndl = DataLoader(c, batch_size=5, shuffle=True)\nlist(dl)\n\n[tensor([ 3, 12,  8, 10,  2]),\n tensor([ 9,  4,  7, 14,  5]),\n tensor([ 1, 13,  0,  6, 11])]\n\n\n\nBut in training model scenarios we won’t need any pyhton collection, we want a collection containing dependent and independent variables.\n\nA tuple that contains dependents and independent variables called in Pytorch a Dataset\n\nHere is a simple dataset:\n\n\nds = L(enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase))\nds\n\n(#26) [(0, 'a'),(1, 'b'),(2, 'c'),(3, 'd'),(4, 'e'),(5, 'f'),(6, 'g'),(7, 'h'),(8, 'i'),(9, 'j')...]\n\n\n\nWhen we pass a Dataset to a DataLoader we will get back mini-batches which are themselves tuples of tensors representing batches of independent and dependent variables:\n\n\ndl = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=6, shuffle=True)\nlist(dl)\n\n[(tensor([17, 18, 10, 22,  8, 14]), ('r', 's', 'k', 'w', 'i', 'o')),\n (tensor([20, 15,  9, 13, 21, 12]), ('u', 'p', 'j', 'n', 'v', 'm')),\n (tensor([ 7, 25,  6,  5, 11, 23]), ('h', 'z', 'g', 'f', 'l', 'x')),\n (tensor([ 1,  3,  0, 24, 19, 16]), ('b', 'd', 'a', 'y', 't', 'q')),\n (tensor([2, 4]), ('c', 'e'))]\n\n\n\n\nPutting It All Together\nNow we have :\n* dset, valid_dset * linear1 * mnist_loss * sigmoid_function\nwe can create the model from scratch\nFirst we re-intialize our parameters:\n\nweights = init_params((28*28,1))\nbias = init_params(1)\n\n\nThen create the DataLoader from Dataset\n\n\ndl = DataLoader(dset, batch_size=256)\nxb,yb = first(dl)\nxb.shape,yb.shape\n\n(torch.Size([256, 784]), torch.Size([256, 1]))\n\n\n\nWe’ll do the same for the validation set:\n\n\nvalid_dl = DataLoader(valid_dset, batch_size=256)\n\n\nLet’s create a mini-batch of size 4 for testing:\n\n\nbatch = train_x[:4]\nbatch.shape\n\ntorch.Size([4, 784])\n\n\n\nCall linear1 model we created earlier on the batch:\n\n\npreds = linear1(batch)\npreds\n\ntensor([[-2.1876],\n        [-8.3973],\n        [ 2.5000],\n        [-4.9473]], grad_fn=&lt;AddBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nCreate the loss function:\n\n\nloss = mnist_loss(preds, train_y[:4])\nloss\n\ntensor(0.7419, grad_fn=&lt;MeanBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nNow we can calculate the gradients:\n\n\nloss.backward()\nweights.grad.shape,weights.grad.mean(),bias.grad\n\n(torch.Size([784, 1]), tensor(-0.0061), tensor([-0.0420]))\n\n\n\nLet’s put that all these steps in a single function:\n\n\ndef calc_grad(xb, yb, model):\n    preds = model(xb)\n    loss = mnist_loss(preds, yb)\n    loss.backward()\n\n\nAnd test it..\n\n\ncalc_grad(batch, train_y[:4], linear1)\nweights.grad.mean(), bias.grad\n\n(tensor(-0.0121), tensor([-0.0840]))\n\n\n\nBut look what happens if we call it twice:\n\n\ncalc_grad(batch, train_y[:4], linear1)\nweights.grad.mean(),bias.grad\n\n(tensor(-0.0182), tensor([-0.1260]))\n\n\n\nThe gradients have changed!\n\nin order to not calculate the gradients and add to the last one every time we call this function calc_gradwe need to use grad.zero_ which set the current gradients to zero\n\n\n\nweights.grad.zero_()\nbias.grad.zero_();\n\n\nOur only remaining step is to update the weights and biases based on the gradient and learning rate. When we do so, we have to tell PyTorch not to take the gradient of this step too—otherwise things will get very confusing when we try to compute the derivative at the next batch! If we assign to the data attribute of a tensor then PyTorch will not take the gradient of that step. Here’s our basic training loop for an epoch:\n\n\ndef train_epoch(model, lr, params):\n    for xb,yb in dl:\n        calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n        for p in params:\n            p.data -= p.grad*lr\n            p.grad.zero_()\n\n\nLet’s build a function that calculate the batch accuracy\n\n\n# accuracy of the batch\n(preds&gt;0.0).float() == train_y[:4]\n\ntensor([[False],\n        [False],\n        [ True],\n        [False]])\n\n\n\nFunction to calculate our validation accuracy:\n\n\ndef batch_accuracy(xb, yb):\n    preds = xb.sigmoid()\n    correct = (preds&gt;0.5) == yb\n    return correct.float().mean()\n\n\n# check if it works\nbatch_accuracy(linear1(batch), train_y[:4])\n\ntensor(0.2500)\n\n\n\n# all together\ndef validate_epoch(model):\n    accs = [batch_accuracy(model(xb), yb) for xb,yb in valid_dl]\n    return round(torch.stack(accs).mean().item(), 4)\n\n\nvalidate_epoch(linear1)\n\n0.5262\n\n\n\nNow lets train for one epoch and see if the accuracy improve\n\n\nlr = 1.\nparams = weights,bias\ntrain_epoch(linear1, lr, params)\nvalidate_epoch(linear1)\n\n0.6663\n\n\n\nThats promising\n\nfrom 0.4642 to 0.6096 after one epoch\n\nThen do a few more:\n\n\nfor i in range(20):\n    train_epoch(linear1, lr, params)\n    print(validate_epoch(linear1), end=' ')\n\n0.8265 0.89 0.9183 0.9276 0.9398 0.9467 0.9506 0.9525 0.9559 0.9579 0.9599 0.9608 0.9613 0.9618 0.9633 0.9638 0.9647 0.9657 0.9672 0.9677 \n\n\n\n\nCreating an Optimizer\n\nAs we know the model we created is only for learning .\n\nin real world scenarios we do not need to implement everything from scratch, framworks like Pytorch and Fastai provide us with everything.\n\nThe linear1 model we created can be remplaced with nn.Linear which can do the same work and more\n\nnn.Linear combine the role of linear1 and weights+bias\n\n\n\nlinear_model = nn.Linear(28*28, 1)\n\n\nEvery PyTorch module knows what parameters it has that can be trained; they are available through the parameters method:\n\n\nw, b = linear_model.parameters()\nw.shape, b.shape\n\n(torch.Size([1, 784]), torch.Size([1]))\n\n\n\nWe can create optimizer class\n\n\nclass BasicOptim:\n    def __init__(self,params,lr): self.params,self.lr = list(params),lr\n\n    def step(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        for p in self.params: p.data -= p.grad.data * self.lr\n\n    def zero_grad(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        for p in self.params: p.grad = None\n\n\n# passing the model params to the optimizer\nopt = BasicOptim(linear_model.parameters(), lr)\n\n\n# simplifying the epoch training function\ndef train_epoch(model):\n    for xb,yb in dl:\n        calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n        opt.step()\n        opt.zero_grad()\n\n\n# validation doesn't change\nvalidate_epoch(linear_model)\n\n0.4606\n\n\n\n# simplifying the training loop:\ndef train_model(model, epochs):\n    for i in range(epochs):\n        train_epoch(model)\n        print(validate_epoch(model), end=' ')\n\n\n# same results as before\ntrain_model(linear_model, 20)\n\n0.4932 0.7686 0.8555 0.9136 0.9346 0.9482 0.957 0.9634 0.9658 0.9678 0.9697 0.9717 0.9736 0.9746 0.9761 0.9771 0.9775 0.9775 0.978 0.9785 \n\n\n\nThe good thing is all of this is provided by Fastai:\n\n\nlinear_model = nn.Linear(28*28,1)\nopt = SGD(linear_model.parameters(), lr)\ntrain_model(linear_model, 20)\n\n0.4932 0.8179 0.8496 0.9141 0.9346 0.9482 0.957 0.9619 0.9658 0.9673 0.9692 0.9712 0.9741 0.9751 0.9761 0.9775 0.9775 0.978 0.9785 0.979 \n\n\n\nFastai also provides Learner.fit, which we can use instead of train_model. To create a Learner we first need to create a DataLoaders, by passing in our training and validation DataLoaders:\n\n\ndls = DataLoaders(dl, valid_dl)\n\n\nTo create a Learner we need to pass in all the elements that we’ve created in this chapter: the DataLoaders, the model, the optimization function (which will be passed the parameters), the loss function, and optionally any metrics to print:\n\n\nlearn = Learner(dls, nn.Linear(28*28,1), opt_func=SGD,\n                loss_func=mnist_loss, metrics=batch_accuracy)\n\nNow we can call fit:\n\nlearn.fit(10, lr=lr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nbatch_accuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.636709\n0.503144\n0.495584\n00:00\n\n\n1\n0.429828\n0.248517\n0.777233\n00:00\n\n\n2\n0.161680\n0.155361\n0.861629\n00:00\n\n\n3\n0.072948\n0.097721\n0.917566\n00:00\n\n\n4\n0.040128\n0.073205\n0.936212\n00:00\n\n\n5\n0.027210\n0.059466\n0.950442\n00:00\n\n\n6\n0.021837\n0.050799\n0.957802\n00:00\n\n\n7\n0.019398\n0.044980\n0.964181\n00:00\n\n\n8\n0.018122\n0.040853\n0.966143\n00:00\n\n\n9\n0.017330\n0.037788\n0.968106\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Nonlinearity\n\nSo far we managed to create a linear function that can predict hand written digit with high performance.\nBut still, it’s just a simple linear classifier, with very constraint abilities.\nTo make it more complex and capable handle complex tasks, we need to add something non-linear between two linear classifiers.\n\nThis is gives us a Neural network\n\nHere a basic architecture of a neural network:\n\n\ndef simple_net(xb): \n    res = xb@w1 + b1 # first linear function\n    res = res.max(tensor(0.0)) # non linear function\n    res = res@w2 + b2  # 2nd linear function\n    return res\n\n\nw1 = init_params((28*28,30))\nb1 = init_params(30)\nw2 = init_params((30,1))\nb2 = init_params(1)\n\n\nw1.shape, b1.shape\n\n(torch.Size([784, 30]), torch.Size([30]))\n\n\n\nthe lines: res = xb@w1 + b1 and res@w2 + b2 are two classifier, basic linear function similar to the nn.Linear we use previously\nWhile the line res = res.max(tensor(0.0)) is a non linear function\n\nthis function called rectified linear unit ReLu which return every negative number with 0\n\nSo if we think about this architecture we have here:\n\nfirst we have a linear function that does the matrix multiplication between dataset tensors and initialzed weights + bias and output 30 (we can chose any number) features, which represent for each a different mix of pixels\nthese outputs are taken by the ReLU and converted to 0 if they are negativem and x==y if it not, then output also 30 features to the next linear layer, which will do the sam computaion as the first and output the results\n\nIn pythorch there’s a modul that fit our neural nets here: nn.Sequential().\n\ntake results from a layer to another\n\nwe also replace the linear function we built by nn.Linear and max((0.0)) with nn.ReLU()\n\n\nsimple_net = nn.Sequential(\n    nn.Linear(28*28,30),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.Linear(30,1)\n)\n\n\n#lets try the model again but now with 2 layers\nlearn = Learner(dls, simple_net, opt_func=SGD,\n                loss_func=mnist_loss, metrics=batch_accuracy)\n\n\nlearn.fit(40, 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nbatch_accuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.333021\n0.396112\n0.512267\n00:00\n\n\n1\n0.152461\n0.235238\n0.797350\n00:00\n\n\n2\n0.083573\n0.117471\n0.911678\n00:00\n\n\n3\n0.054309\n0.078720\n0.940628\n00:00\n\n\n4\n0.040829\n0.061228\n0.956330\n00:00\n\n\n5\n0.034006\n0.051490\n0.963690\n00:00\n\n\n6\n0.030123\n0.045381\n0.966634\n00:00\n\n\n7\n0.027619\n0.041218\n0.968106\n00:00\n\n\n8\n0.025825\n0.038200\n0.969087\n00:00\n\n\n9\n0.024441\n0.035901\n0.969578\n00:00\n\n\n10\n0.023321\n0.034082\n0.971541\n00:00\n\n\n11\n0.022387\n0.032598\n0.972031\n00:00\n\n\n12\n0.021592\n0.031353\n0.974485\n00:00\n\n\n13\n0.020904\n0.030284\n0.975466\n00:00\n\n\n14\n0.020300\n0.029352\n0.975466\n00:00\n\n\n15\n0.019766\n0.028526\n0.975466\n00:00\n\n\n16\n0.019288\n0.027788\n0.976448\n00:00\n\n\n17\n0.018857\n0.027124\n0.977429\n00:00\n\n\n18\n0.018465\n0.026523\n0.978410\n00:00\n\n\n19\n0.018107\n0.025977\n0.978901\n00:00\n\n\n20\n0.017777\n0.025479\n0.978901\n00:00\n\n\n21\n0.017473\n0.025022\n0.979392\n00:00\n\n\n22\n0.017191\n0.024601\n0.980373\n00:00\n\n\n23\n0.016927\n0.024213\n0.980373\n00:00\n\n\n24\n0.016680\n0.023855\n0.981354\n00:00\n\n\n25\n0.016449\n0.023521\n0.981354\n00:00\n\n\n26\n0.016230\n0.023211\n0.981354\n00:00\n\n\n27\n0.016023\n0.022922\n0.981354\n00:00\n\n\n28\n0.015827\n0.022653\n0.981845\n00:00\n\n\n29\n0.015641\n0.022401\n0.981845\n00:00\n\n\n30\n0.015463\n0.022165\n0.981845\n00:00\n\n\n31\n0.015294\n0.021944\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n32\n0.015132\n0.021736\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n33\n0.014977\n0.021541\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n34\n0.014828\n0.021357\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n35\n0.014686\n0.021184\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n36\n0.014549\n0.021019\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n37\n0.014417\n0.020864\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n38\n0.014290\n0.020716\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n39\n0.014168\n0.020576\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we did everything we can to improve the model performane, and we got an accuracy of 982826, which is very solid number.\nfrom here on, all we can do is looking inside our model and understand the mechanic of it in each steps\n\n\n# we can see the architecture of the model\nm =learn.model\n\n\nAs expected the model architecture contains 2 layers and a non-linear function in-between.\n\n\nm\n\nSequential(\n  (0): Linear(in_features=784, out_features=30, bias=True)\n  (1): ReLU()\n  (2): Linear(in_features=30, out_features=1, bias=True)\n)\n\n\n\nWe could also see what did the model learn in each layer\n\n\nw, b= m[0].parameters()\n\n\nshow_image(w[22].view(28,28))\n\n&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7eff5bce6210&gt;"

with a model that has already be trained and we use it on our problem and on our dataset, this operation needs to adapt the pre-trained model by a bit so it fit our system\nThis approach can save us money and time, all we need to do is adapt the pre-trained model and take advantage of set of weights and use them in our problem\n\n\n\nLearner\nIn Fastai we have the Learner which takes 2 things(For now!): firsly the Dataset, and secondly the Model.\nBecause Deep Learning is more mature now,there’s a small group of Architecture that can be used in nearly any problem, that’s why the actual work of deep learning practionaire is to work on data preparation, and model deploying, more than anything else.\nThis is why Fastai integrated a famous library Timm which collect all SOTA (State Of The Art) computer vision models.\n\n\nVisualizing layers of a trained neural network\n\nIt is possible to inspect deep learning models and get insights from them\n\ncan still be challenging to fully understand\n\nVisualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks paper\n\npublished by PhD student Matt Zeiler and his supervisor Rob Fergus in 2013\nshowed how to visualize the neural network weights learned in each layer of a model\ndiscovered the early layers in a convolutional neural network recognize edges and simple patterns which are combined in later layers to detect more complex shapes\n\nWe will see this paper in details later, but for now we could show the model architecture.\n\n\n# show the model architecture\nm = learn.model\nm\n\nSequential(\n  (0): Sequential(\n    (0):

We then start to look how to extract the data we want from it, and what the data looks like, and how it is structured.\nUsually data is provided in one of two ways:\n\nIndividual files representing items of data, possibly organized into folder or with filenames representing information about those items\n\ntext documents\n\nimages\n\n\nA table of data in which each row is an item and may include filenames providing connections between the data in the table and data in other formats\n\nCSV files\n\n\n\nExceptions:\n\nDomains like Genomics\n\nbinary database formats\n\nnetwork streams\n\n\n\n# download the dataset\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.PETS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [811712512/811706944 01:02&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n#get the path as variable, and see what inside\nPath.BASE_PATH = path\npath.ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('images'),Path('annotations')]\n\n\n\nAs we notice here, the data is provided with 2 directories:\n\nimages\nannotations\n\n\n\n#take a look at what inside the images directory\n(path/'images').ls()\n\n(#7393) [Path('images/german_shorthaired_87.jpg'),Path('images/Russian_Blue_200.jpg'),Path('images/Siamese_25.jpg'),Path('images/japanese_chin_48.jpg'),Path('images/miniature_pinscher_161.jpg'),Path('images/pug_150.jpg'),Path('images/pug_120.jpg'),Path('images/pug_63.jpg'),Path('images/samoyed_143.jpg'),Path('images/yorkshire_terrier_190.jpg')...]\n\n\n\nWhen we took a look at these names, we see some paterns: we already know from chapter1 that cats name are uppercase, here we see that after the breed’s name there is a (_) then a number, and finally the extension.\nThis may help us to write some code that extract the breed from a single Path.\n\n\n#pick one \nfname = (path/\"images\").ls()[0]\nfname\n\nPath('images/german_shorthaired_87.jpg')\n\n\n\nThe best way to work with strings and extract patterns from them is to use Regex, which stands for Regular Expression.\n\n\nre.findall(r'(.+)_\\d+.jpg$', fname.name)\n\n['german_shorthaired']\n\n\n\nNow we need to label the whole dataset using this code.\nFastai comes with many classes for labeling, in this case when we need to label with help of regex we could use RegexLabeller class within DataBlaock API.\n\n\npets = DataBlock(blocks = (ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n                 get_items=get_image_files, \n                 splitter=RandomSplitter(seed=42),\n                 get_y=using_attr(RegexLabeller(r'(.+)_\\d+.jpg$'), 'name'),\n                 item_tfms=Resize(460),\n                 batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\ndls = pets.dataloaders(path/\"images\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFastai has this method of presizing the images in a way that conserve its quality after the data augmentation, so it helps the model to learn more lessons from data, and also it helps our dataset to be more varies\nThe idea behind the presizing is we crop the image and resize it to 460 by 460 first, which is a big size by deep learning norms, this operation is done on CPU, then we do the data augmentation in batches, by cropping a rotated random part of that 460^2 image, and taking the cropped image then resize again to a 224 by 224 image, all this operation are done on batch level, which mean on GPU.**\n\n\nitem_tfms=Resize(460),  \nbatch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\n![REsize_method](1.png)\n\n* Usually all the augmentation operations we do on a image reduce the quality of the image, but with this approach we could say we can preserve big part of informations of that image so the model can learn better \n\n### Checking and Debugging a DataBlock\n\n* `DataBlock` is just a blueprint for orginizing data before we feed it to the model, you have no guarantee that your template is going to work on your data source as you intend.\n* So, before training a model you should always check your data. You can do this using the show_batch method:\n\n::: {.cell outputId='0f1711e2-f2c6-4703-ed64-1ea456f04a2d' execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndls.show_batch(nrows=1, ncols=4 ,unique= True)\n\n\n\n:::\n\nIn case we made a mistake in the process of creating datablock, we could use .summary to track the problem.Here we didn’t resize the images in one formm, so couldn’t use the batch transform\nAs we see here the .summary gives us precise diagnostic of the problem:**\n\nat least two tensors in the batch are not the same size.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we feel like the datablock is well created, we better begin train the model, and use it as a tool of cleaning the data. If there’s a problem with data or the model, we better know that before we lost lot of time and energy on data cleaning even before testing the model.\n\n\n# train the model\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fine_tune(2)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:209: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15, please use 'weights' instead.\n  f\"The parameter '{pretrained_param}' is deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15, \"\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15.

But here we didn’t create any loss function?\nIf we didn’t decide the way by which we update the paramters, Fastai by default will chose a loss function for us.\n\nthe chosen loss function will suite the kind of model we build, and the type of dataset we have.\n\n\n\n# check the loss function\nlearn.loss_func\n\nFlattenedLoss of CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n\n\nThe loss function used to train this model is Cross Entropy Loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cross-Entropy Loss is a function similar to what we saw in the previous chapter, when we created the mnist_loss function:\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n    prediction = prediction.sigmoid()\n    return torch.where(targets==1, 1-prediction, predictions).mean()\n\nThe problem with this function is, it only takes 2 categories(3, 7) but here we have 37 types of breeds.but here we have multiple classes.\n\nit can takes more than 2 categories\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the cross-entropy loss, let’s grab a batch of data\n\n\nx,y = dls.one_batch()\n\n\nIt return the activations of dependent and independent variable of one mini-batch\n\n\n# independent variable\ny, len(y)\n\n(TensorCategory([ 8, 34,  6, 33, 12, 15, 32, 14,  5, 27, 20, 32, 18, 24,  8, 29,  5,  4,  0, 28, 10, 12, 16, 25, 29,  3, 34, 27, 30, 15,  6, 15, 27, 34, 14, 21,  5, 17, 31, 26, 13, 35, 17, 35, 23, 14,\n                 35, 35,  8,  7, 21,  0, 22, 17, 19, 26, 16,  5, 15, 27, 11, 22, 34, 18], device='cuda:0'),\n 64)\n\n\n\nIt return 64 number, each represent on of the 37 breeds index\n\n\n# all indepent variables\ndls.vocab, len(dls.vocab)\n\n(['Abyssinian', 'Bengal', 'Birman', 'Bombay', 'British_Shorthair', 'Egyptian_Mau', 'Maine_Coon', 'Persian', 'Ragdoll', 'Russian_Blue', 'Siamese', 'Sphynx', 'american_bulldog', 'american_pit_bull_terrier', 'basset_hound', 'beagle', 'boxer', 'chihuahua', 'english_cocker_spaniel', 'english_setter', 'german_shorthaired', 'great_pyrenees', 'havanese', 'japanese_chin', 'keeshond', 'leonberger', 'miniature_pinscher', 'newfoundland', 'pomeranian', 'pug', 'saint_bernard', 'samoyed', 'scottish_terrier', 'shiba_inu', 'staffordshire_bull_terrier', 'wheaten_terrier', 'yorkshire_terrier'],\n 37)\n\n\n\nHere we use get_preds to get the predictions for each image in the dataset or mini-batch (like in this example).\n\n\npreds,_ = learn.get_preds(dl=[(x,y)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# prediction for image [0] in the mini-batch\npreds[0]\n\nTensorBase([1.0919e-05, 6.0375e-08, 8.5680e-05, 7.1281e-07, 1.8754e-06, 4.7956e-07, 1.1708e-04, 1.4080e-06, 9.9972e-01, 9.4731e-07, 6.8318e-08, 1.7055e-07, 1.9338e-06, 7.7372e-07, 1.7931e-07,\n            1.5261e-07, 1.1363e-08, 2.3353e-07, 1.3689e-07, 4.5361e-07, 7.1548e-08, 4.9425e-06, 1.0026e-05, 2.6908e-07, 3.5724e-07, 3.1201e-07, 1.0177e-08, 2.7219e-08, 1.6157e-06, 3.5337e-08,\n            1.8094e-06, 3.3425e-05, 2.3514e-08, 3.0318e-06, 1.4910e-07, 1.9582e-07, 9.5147e-08])\n\n\n\nThe 37 predictions refer to the probability of each breed to match the image[0].\n\nif we sum() them up they add up to 1:\n\n\n\npreds[0].sum()\n\nTensorBase(1.0000)\n\n\n\nIn order to transform the activations of our model into prediction, we use Soft-Max\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we said before, Softmax is similar to sigmoid function we use before, but it only can handel more than 2 classes.\n\n\n# reminder of sigmoid\nplot_function(torch.sigmoid, min=-4,max=4)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function allow us to predict whether a activation number is pointing to each category of the two, by calculating which activation is big and by much.

One benefit of using the log to calculate the loss is that our loss function penalizes predictions that are both confident and wrong. This kind of penalty works well in practice to aid in more effective model training.\n\nCalculating the loss pay attention only to the high softmax value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking the log of the softmax, we can then call the negative log likelihood.\n\nfirst : log_softmax\nthen : nll_loss\nor : nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n\n\nloss_func = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n\nloss_func(acts, targs)\n\ntensor(1.8045)\n\n\n\nnn.CrossEntropyLoss()(acts, targs)\n\ntensor(1.8045)\n\n\n\nThe nn.CrossEntrpyLoss() make do all the steps for us, but if we want to go through all those steps one by one softmas+log then negative log we could do it also:\n\n\nF.nll_loss(nn.Softmax()(acts).log(), targs,)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:1: UserWarning: Implicit dimension choice for softmax has been deprecated.

Loss also get better by this percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are familiar with the idea of Transfer Learning, where we use a pretrainned model on our dataset, by fine tuning it in a way that keep all the learned weights and use them in our task.\nWe know tha Convolutional Neural Network consist of many linear layers, and between each two of them there’s a nonlinear activation function (ReLU for example), followed by the final layer with an activation function such as Softmax. The final layer uses a matrix with enough columns such that the ouput size is has the number of classes our model trained to predict(assuming we have a classfication task) This final linear layer is unlikely to be of any use for us when we are fine-tuning in a transfer learning setting, because it is specifically designed to classify the categories in the original pretraining dataset.\nSo we first delete it when we start the transfer learning process, and replace it with a new linear layer with the correct number of outputs that matches our desired task(in this case 37 breeds, so 37 activations)\nThis new linear layer have total randome set of weights, but that doesn’t mean we should set all weights randomly even for the pretrained part.\n\nAll of the layers prior to the last one have been carefully trained to be good at image classification tasks in general. As we saw in the images from the Zeiler and Fergus paper, the first few layers encode very general concepts, such as finding gradients and edges, and later layers encode concepts that are still very useful for us, such as finding eyeballs and fur.\n\nWe want to build a model such as preserve all the learned weights, and apply them on our dataset, so only adjust them as required for the specifics of our particular task.\nSo, the idea is to keep the pretrained part’s weights intact, and only update the weights of the added part. This process is called Freezing\nWhen we create a model from a pretrained network fastai automatically freezes all of the pretrained layers for us. When we call the fine_tune method fastai does two things:\n\nTrains the randomly added layers for one epoch, with all other layers frozen\nUnfreezes all of the layers, and trains them all for the number of epochs requested\n\nOf Course this is just the default approach, fine_tune has many parameters that allow us to apply different tweaks for each specific situation.\nFor now, let’s do this process manually without using fine_tune\n\n\n# check fine_tune source acode\nlearn.fine_tune??\n\n\nFirst we create our learner from the dls and arch using vision_learner\n\nby default vision_learner will freeze the pre-trained part of the model (freeze the params)\n\nThen train the added layer with randome weights for number of epochs with a learning rate we pick\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.114612\n0.429605\n0.134641\n01:10\n\n\n1\n0.538649\n0.245115\n0.083221\n01:10\n\n\n2\n0.313570\n0.207912\n0.065629\n01:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to unfreeze the model:\n\n\nlearn.unfreeze()\n\n\nNow we run lr_find again, because having more layers to train, and weights that have already been trained for three epochs, means our previously found learning rate isn’t appropriate any more:\n\n\nlearn.lr_find()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestedLRs(valley=9.999999747378752e-06)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we see here the graph is different than what we saw before when we use randome weights to train the model, because that the model has been trained already.\nThe approach to pick the right lr here is to chose a point before the sharp increase.\n\n\n34se3a\n\n\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(6 , lr_max=4.786300905834651e-06)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.260985\n0.207057\n0.062246\n01:16\n\n\n1\n0.244476\n0.201592\n0.064276\n01:18\n\n\n2\n0.240523\n0.193317\n0.058187\n01:15\n\n\n3\n0.234724\n0.189429\n0.054127\n01:15\n\n\n4\n0.227204\n0.188406\n0.056157\n01:21\n\n\n5\n0.209963\n0.187695\n0.056157\n01:16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter training the model for 6 epochs we get eror_rate at 6% which is fine, but we could do better.\nThe thing we could optimize here is to rethink the learning rate again.\n\npicking one learning rate value for the whole neural network isn’t a good idea.\nthe model is consisted of 2 parts as we know:\n\nthe pre-trained part contained good parameters that has been trained for many epochs\nthe last layer which we trained ourself for not more than 10 (3+6)\n\nso idea here is we shouldn’t trait both parts as if they are the same by picking one learning rate for the whole model\ninstead we could go with a small lr value for the first part, then aplly a slightly bigger one for the last layer.\n\nThis technic is devloped by Jason Yosinski and his team. They shows in 2014 that with transfer learning, different layer should be trained at different speed. \n\nFastai adopt this idea by using slice, which is a built-in object that let you pass 2 values:\n\nthe first define the learning rate of the earlier layer\nthe second for the last layers\n\nThe layers in between will have learning rates that are multiplicatively equidistant throughout that range\n\nLet’s see this technic in action\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3)\nlearn.unfreeze()\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(14, lr_max=slice(1e-6,1e-4))\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:209: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15, please use 'weights' instead.\n  f\"The parameter '{pretrained_param}' is deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15, \"\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15.

You can pass the batch size you want to the call creating your DataLoaders with bs=\n\nThe other downside of deeper architectures is that they take quite a bit longer to train.\n\nOne technique that can speed things up a lot is mixed-precision training. This refers to using less-precise numbers (half-precision floating point, also called fp16) where possible during training.\nTo enable this feature in fastai, just add to_fp16() after your Learner creation (you also need to import the module).\n\nYou can’t really know ahead of time what the best architecture for your particular problem is—you need to try training some.

One benefit of using the log to calculate the loss is that our loss function penalizes predictions that are both confident and wrong. This kind of penalty works well in practice to aid in more effective model training.\n\nCalculating the loss pay attention only to the high softmax value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking the log of the softmax, we can then call the negative log likelihood.\n\nfirst : log_softmax\nthen : nll_loss\nor : nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n\n\nloss_func = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n\nloss_func(acts, targs)\n\ntensor(1.8045)\n\n\n\nnn.CrossEntropyLoss()(acts, targs)\n\ntensor(1.8045)\n\n\n\nThe nn.CrossEntrpyLoss() make do all the steps for us, but if we want to go through all those steps one by one softmas+log then negative log we could do it also:\n\n\nF.nll_loss(nn.Softmax()(acts).log(), targs,)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:1: UserWarning: Implicit dimension choice for softmax has been deprecated.

Loss also get better by this percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are familiar with the idea of Transfer Learning, where we use a pretrainned model on our dataset, by fine tuning it in a way that keep all the learned weights and use them in our task.\nWe know tha Convolutional Neural Network consist of many linear layers, and between each two of them there’s a nonlinear activation function (ReLU for example), followed by the final layer with an activation function such as Softmax. The final layer uses a matrix with enough columns such that the ouput size is has the number of classes our model trained to predict(assuming we have a classfication task) This final linear layer is unlikely to be of any use for us when we are fine-tuning in a transfer learning setting, because it is specifically designed to classify the categories in the original pretraining dataset.\nSo we first delete it when we start the transfer learning process, and replace it with a new linear layer with the correct number of outputs that matches our desired task(in this case 37 breeds, so 37 activations)\nThis new linear layer have total randome set of weights, but that doesn’t mean we should set all weights randomly even for the pretrained part.\n\nAll of the layers prior to the last one have been carefully trained to be good at image classification tasks in general. As we saw in the images from the Zeiler and Fergus paper, the first few layers encode very general concepts, such as finding gradients and edges, and later layers encode concepts that are still very useful for us, such as finding eyeballs and fur.\n\nWe want to build a model such as preserve all the learned weights, and apply them on our dataset, so only adjust them as required for the specifics of our particular task.\nSo, the idea is to keep the pretrained part’s weights intact, and only update the weights of the added part. This process is called Freezing\nWhen we create a model from a pretrained network fastai automatically freezes all of the pretrained layers for us. When we call the fine_tune method fastai does two things:\n\nTrains the randomly added layers for one epoch, with all other layers frozen\nUnfreezes all of the layers, and trains them all for the number of epochs requested\n\nOf Course this is just the default approach, fine_tune has many parameters that allow us to apply different tweaks for each specific situation.\nFor now, let’s do this process manually without using fine_tune\n\n\n# check fine_tune source acode\nlearn.fine_tune??\n\n\nFirst we create our learner from the dls and arch using vision_learner\n\nby default vision_learner will freeze the pre-trained part of the model (freeze the params)\n\nThen train the added layer with randome weights for number of epochs with a learning rate we pick\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.114612\n0.429605\n0.134641\n01:10\n\n\n1\n0.538649\n0.245115\n0.083221\n01:10\n\n\n2\n0.313570\n0.207912\n0.065629\n01:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to unfreeze the model:\n\n\nlearn.unfreeze()\n\n\nNow we run lr_find again, because having more layers to train, and weights that have already been trained for three epochs, means our previously found learning rate isn’t appropriate any more:\n\n\nlearn.lr_find()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestedLRs(valley=9.999999747378752e-06)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we see here the graph is different than what we saw before when we use randome weights to train the model, because that the model has been trained already.\nThe approach to pick the right lr here is to chose a point before the sharp increase.\n\n\n34se3a\n\n\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(6 , lr_max=4.786300905834651e-06)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.260985\n0.207057\n0.062246\n01:16\n\n\n1\n0.244476\n0.201592\n0.064276\n01:18\n\n\n2\n0.240523\n0.193317\n0.058187\n01:15\n\n\n3\n0.234724\n0.189429\n0.054127\n01:15\n\n\n4\n0.227204\n0.188406\n0.056157\n01:21\n\n\n5\n0.209963\n0.187695\n0.056157\n01:16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter training the model for 6 epochs we get eror_rate at 6% which is fine, but we could do better.\nThe thing we could optimize here is to rethink the learning rate again.\n\npicking one learning rate value for the whole neural network isn’t a good idea.\nthe model is consisted of 2 parts as we know:\n\nthe pre-trained part contained good parameters that has been trained for many epochs\nthe last layer which we trained ourself for not more than 10 (3+6)\n\nso idea here is we shouldn’t trait both parts as if they are the same by picking one learning rate for the whole model\ninstead we could go with a small lr value for the first part, then aplly a slightly bigger one for the last layer.\n\nThis technic is devloped by Jason Yosinski and his team.

You can pass the batch size you want to the call creating your DataLoaders with bs=\n\nThe other downside of deeper architectures is that they take quite a bit longer to train.\n\nOne technique that can speed things up a lot is mixed-precision training. This refers to using less-precise numbers (half-precision floating point, also called fp16) where possible during training.\nTo enable this feature in fastai, just add to_fp16() after your Learner creation (you also need to import the module).\n\nYou can’t really know ahead of time what the best architecture for your particular problem is—you need to try training some.

She is the matriarch of the powerful House Tyrell, the largest and second wealthiest of the eight Great Houses of Westeros. Olenna is characterized by her cunning, ambition, and sharp wit (the latter of which being the foundation for her title, '''the Queen of Thorns''', alongside the Tyrell sigil of a rose). Although her family is allied with the Lannisters in King's Landing, she often finds her own machinations at odds with theirs, especially those of Tywin Lannister. She, along with Petyr Baelish, is responsible for the death of King Joffrey Baratheon during his wedding to her granddaughter and protégé, Margaery.\\n\\nOlenna is portrayed by veteran English actress Diana Rigg in the HBO television adaptation, who has received significant critical praise for her portrayal. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '8e6c730456b928d065f2dfc8b6af9cae'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': \"Rigg has received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performances in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018.\\n\\n==Character profile==\\nOlenna Tyrell, also known as the Queen of Thorns, is a former Redwyne and the mother of Mace Tyrell.

As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are at holding everything together.

Following his expansion of the series, Martin eventually concluded it would be succeeded by one final novel, ''A Dream of Spring''. By June 2010, Martin had finished four chapters for ''The Winds of Winter'' from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, and Arianne Martell. In July 2010, he added an Aeron Greyjoy chapter that had been moved from ''A Dance with Dragons'' to ''The Winds of Winter'', accumulating around 100 completed manuscript pages. Following the publication of ''A Dance with Dragons'' in the summer of 2011, Martin announced his return to writing  the series in January 2012, having spent the intervening time on his U.S. and overseas book publicity tours and attending various conventions. He continued to work, with his two co-authors Elio García and Linda Antonsson, on the illustrated series companion guide ''The World of Ice & Fire'' concordance and Westeros history. He also worked on a Westeros story, the fourth ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' novella.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 4}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '93ee02d1d61c6f0632b653f00b824f8e'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': \"In December 2011, Martin posted a Theon Greyjoy viewpoint chapter from ''The Winds of Winter''; he also announced that another sample chapter would be included at the end of the North American paperback version of ''A Dance with Dragons'', which was originally expected to be released in summer 2012, but was released on October 29, 2013. (International paperback editions of ''A Dance with Dragons'' published a year earlier did not include a new, as yet unpublished sample chapter.) In the first quarter of 2012, Martin read new chapters of other characters at public events, including the chapters of Victarion Greyjoy and Tyrion Lannister. Martin continued work editing anthologies and completing a large, highly detailed series atlas ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'', which was published in October 2012. Martin published another sample chapter from Arianne Martell's POV on his website in January 2013. On March 27, ten days before the ''Game of Thrones'' season four premiere, Martin posted a chapter on his website, titled ''Mercy''. Martin said the new chapter is actually an old one, though never published nor publicly read.

Filming of the attack sequence took approximately 18 main-unit days, five second-unit days, and several weeks for the effects-unit.

An early suggestion was to use animated maps as a transition between scenes to orient viewers, but that idea was dropped as it would interrupt the narrative flow. The idea of the map was therefore moved into the title sequence.  For the original pilot, the showrunners Benioff and Weiss initially wrote the title sequence as a crow's flight from King's Landing to Winterfell;  however, the production team at Elastic thought the idea was too flat and devised the idea of using 3-D models within a sphere that represents the world of the show.

For the TV series, linguist David J. Peterson created the High Valyrian language, as well as the derivative languages Astapori and Meereenese Valyrian, based on the fragments given in the novels. Valyrian and Dothraki have been described as \"the most convincing fictional tongues since Elvish\".\\n\\n==High Valyrian==\\n\\nIn the world of \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\', High Valyrian occupies a cultural niche similar to that of Latin in medieval Europe.  The novels describe it as no longer being used as a language of everyday communication, but rather as a language of learning and education among the nobility of Essos and Westeros, with much literature and song composed in Valyrian.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '938c434659d8090eac962266bbac1cae'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': '===Creation===\\nDavid J. Peterson, creator of the spoken Valyrian languages for \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\\nTo create the Dothraki and Valyrian languages to be spoken in \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\', HBO selected the linguist David J. Peterson through a competition among conlangers. The producers gave Peterson a largely free hand in developing the languages, as, according to Peterson, George R. R. Martin himself was not very interested in the linguistic aspect of his works. The already published novels include only a few words of High Valyrian, including \\'\\'valar morghulis\\'\\' (\"all men must die\"), \\'\\'valar dohaeris\\'\\' (\"all men must serve\") and \\'\\'dracarys\\'\\' (\"dragonfire\"). For the forthcoming novel \\'\\'The Winds of Winter\\'\\', Peterson has supplied Martin with additional Valyrian translations.\\n\\nPeterson commented that he considered Martin\\'s choice of \\'\\'dracarys\\'\\' unfortunate because of its (presumably intended) similarity to the Latin word for dragon, \\'\\'\\'\\'. Because the Latin language does not exist in the fictional world of \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\', Peterson chose to treat the similarity as coincidental and made \\'\\'dracarys\\'\\' an independent lexeme; his High Valyrian term for dragon is \\'\\'zaldrīzes\\'\\'.

Both prepositions and postpositions are used to form other cases; for example, the ablative is formed with the preposition \\'\\'hen\\'\\' + the locative (e.g. \\'\\'hen lentot\\'\\', \"from a house\") while the superessive is formed with the postposition \\'\\'bē\\'\\' following the genitive (e.g. \\'\\'lento bē\\'\\', \"on top of a house\").\\n\\nThere are four grammatical genders, which do not align with biological sex.

There are two paradigms of verbs, those with a stem ending with a consonant and those with a stem ending with a vowel; the tables below show examples of three tenses in the active voice. It is possible to tell which paradigm is in use from the first person plural indicative—consonant stems will always end in ''-i'', whereas vowels stems will end in ''-ī''. Verbs with stems ending in a vowel follow a pattern where that stem-terminal vowel might change—''-a'' and ''-i'' do not change, ''-e'' becomes ''-i'', but ''-o'' and ''-u'' both become ''-v''. Verb stems may never end in a long vowel or a diphthong. There is a subjunctive mood that is not only used in subordinate clauses, but also in all negative statements.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 7}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3930f926864ed468de5a31bf9d90100f'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': 'Consonantal verbs(\\'\\'manaeragon\\'\\', \"to raise\" or \"to lift\")\\n\\nPresent tense\\n\\nPerfect tense\\n\\nImperfect tense\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nFirst person\\n\\nmanaeran\\n\\nmanaeri\\n\\nmanaeron\\n\\nmanaeroty\\n\\nmanaertan\\n\\nmanaerti\\n\\nmanaerton\\n\\nmanaertoty\\n\\nmanaerilen\\n\\nmanaerilin\\n\\nmanaerilon\\n\\nmanaeriloty\\n\\nSecond person\\n\\nmanaerā\\n\\nmanaerāt\\n\\nmanaerō\\n\\nmanaerōt\\n\\nmanaertā\\n\\nmanaertāt\\n\\nmanaertō\\n\\nmanaertōt\\n\\nmanaerilē\\n\\nmanaerilēt\\n\\nmanaerilō\\n\\nmanaerilōt\\n\\nThird person\\n\\nmanaerza\\n\\nmanaerzi\\n\\nmanaeros\\n\\nmanaerosy\\n\\nmanaertas\\n\\nmanaertis\\n\\nmanaertos\\n\\nmanertosy\\n\\nmanaeriles\\n\\nmanaerilis\\n\\nmanaerilos\\n\\nmanaerilosy\\n\\nImperative\\n\\nmanaerās\\n\\nmanaerātās\\n\\nInfinitive\\n\\nmanaeragon\\n\\nmanaertagon\\n\\nParticiple\\n\\nmanaerare, manaerarior\\n\\nVowel verbs (stem ending -a)(\\'\\'limagon\\'\\', \"to cry\")\\n\\nPresent tense\\n\\nPerfect tense\\n\\nImperfect tense\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nFirst person\\n\\nliman\\n\\nlimī\\n\\nlimaon\\n\\nlimaoty\\n\\nlimatan\\n\\nlimati\\n\\nlimaton\\n\\nlimatoty\\n\\nlimēlen\\n\\nlimēlin\\n\\nlimēlon\\n\\nlimēloty\\n\\nSecond person\\n\\nlimā\\n\\nlimāt\\n\\nlimaō\\n\\nlimaōt\\n\\nlimatā\\n\\nlimatāt\\n\\nlimatō\\n\\nlimatōt\\n\\nlimēlē\\n\\nlimēlēt\\n\\nlimēlō\\n\\nlimēlōt\\n\\nThird person\\n\\nlimas\\n\\nlimasi\\n\\nlimaos\\n\\nlimaosy\\n\\nlimatas\\n\\nlimatasi\\n\\nlimatos\\n\\nlimatosy\\n\\nlimēles\\n\\nlimēlis\\n\\nlimēlos\\n\\nlimēlosy\\n\\nImperative\\n\\nlimās\\n\\nlimātās\\n\\nInfinitive\\n\\nlimagon\\n\\nlimatagon\\n\\nParticiple\\n\\nlimare, limarior\\n\\nVowel verbs (stem ending -e)(\\'\\'sōvegon\\'\\', \"to fly\")\\n\\nPresent tense\\n\\nPerfect tense\\n\\nImperfect tense\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nIndicative mood\\n\\nSubjunctive mood\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nSingular\\n\\nPlural\\n\\nFirst person\\n\\nsōven\\n\\nsōvī\\n\\nsōvion\\n\\nsōvioty\\n\\nsōvetan\\n\\nsōveti\\n\\nsōveton\\n\\nsōvetoty\\n\\nsovīlen\\n\\nsovīlin\\n\\nsovīlon\\n\\nsovīloty\\n\\nSecond person\\n\\nsōvē\\n\\nsōvēt\\n\\nsōviō\\n\\nsōviōt\\n\\nsōvetā\\n\\nsōvetāt\\n\\nsōvetō\\n\\nsōvetōt\\n\\nsovīlē\\n\\nsovīlēt\\n\\nsovīlō\\n\\nsovīlōt\\n\\nThird person\\n\\nsōves\\n\\nsōvesi\\n\\nsōvios\\n\\nsōviosy\\n\\nsōvetas\\n\\nsōvetis\\n\\nsōvetos\\n\\nsōvetosy\\n\\nsovīles\\n\\nsovīli\\n\\nsovīlos\\n\\nsovīlosy\\n\\nImperative\\n\\nsōvēs\\n\\nsōvētēs\\n\\nInfinitive\\n\\nsōvegon\\n\\nsōvetagon\\n\\nParticiple\\n\\nsōvere, sōverior\\n\\n====Adjectives====\\nAdjectives have three declension classes.

As a part of this update, Peterson created audio for the course\\'s lessons and exercises.\\n\\n==Derivative languages==\\nIn the world of the novel and TV series, the Nine Free Cities of Essos speak variants of High Valyrian, described by the character Tyrion in \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' as \"not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues\". The cities of Slaver\\'s Bay speak related languages, descended from High Valyrian with the substrate of the local Ghiscari languages. Peterson noted that with regard to the vocabulary of the derived languages, \"If it’s got a j in an odd place, it’s probably Ghiscari in origin.\"Peterson described the relationship between High Valyrian and the Free Cities languages as being similar to that between classical Latin and the Romance languages, or more accurately between Classical Arabic and the modern varieties of Arabic, in that High Valyrian is intelligible, with some difficulty, to a speaker of a local Essoan language.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 13}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'fc94bfba159d37b062d239899f658974'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': '===Astapori Valyrian===\\n\\nThe first derivative Valyrian language to be featured in the series was Astapori Valyrian, a variety from the city of Astapor in Slaver\\'s Bay. It appeared in the third-season premiere episode \"Valar Dohaeris\".  Peterson created the Astapori dialogue by first writing the text in High Valyrian, then applying a series of regular grammar and sound changes to simulate the changes in natural languages over a long period of time.\\n\\nFor example, Astapori Valyrian has lost all long vowels (designated with a macron) and most diphthongs. Between vowels, b, d, g have become v, ð, ɣ; subsequently, p, t, k have become b, d, g in the same environment.\\nAs a result, an \"Unsullied\" is rendered as \\'\\'Dovaogēdy\\'\\'  in High Valyrian, but as \\'\\'Dovoghedhy\\'\\'  in Astapori. Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the case system of High Valyrian, so the word order is more reliably subject–verb–object (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three definite articles: \\'\\'ji\\'\\'  (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ziry\\'\\'  \"him/her (accusative)\"), \\'\\'vi\\'\\'  (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ūī\\'\\'  \"it (accusative)\"), and \\'\\'po\\'\\'  (plural, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'pōnte\\'\\'  \"them (accusative)\").

Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was \"immediately sure\" of how the dress should look.

Djawadi stated, \"The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano.

The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying \"The boys I recorded completely separate.

The title of the episode, \"Stormborn\", is a reference to Daenerys Targaryen, who was born in the midst of a great storm, earning her that nickname. In the \"Inside the Episode\" segment published by HBO following the initial airing of the episode, co-creators and executive producers of the series David Benioff and D. B. Weiss were interviewed, saying \"We last saw Nymeria when Arya made her run away because she wanted to save Nymeria\\'s life, - She knew Cersei was going to kill her if she found her, and when she finally finds Nymeria again — or Nymeria finds her — she of course wants Nymeria to come back home with her and be her loyal companion again.

Weiss continued, \"Arya\\'s not domesticated. It makes total sense the wolf wouldn\\'t be either. Once the wolf walks away, at first she\\'s heartbroken to have come this close, but then she realizes the wolf is doing exactly what she would do if she was that wolf.\"===Casting===\\nThe episode featured the return of Ben Hawkey as Hot Pie, who was last seen in season 4\\'s \"Mockingbird\". Hawkey spoke about his return to \\'\\'Entertainment Weekly\\'\\', saying that he did not expect to ever come back. Prior to getting the script and to avoid the return of character to be leaked, the producers gave Hawkey a code name when communicating by email.

Speaking about the battle sequence, Henwick said \"normally there’s a lot of CG and you watch it on screen and you see a massive epic battle, but when you’re filming it’s all quite tame by comparison.

Stunt coordinator Rowley Irlam also stated that they were inspired by riots when it was being choreographed.

The theme for House Stark is the first theme to be composed and is played on a cello. Most of the Stark characters only have variations on the same theme on cello. Arya Stark is the first of the house to have her own theme, first heard when she started her lesson on swordplay in episode three of season one, with the music featuring a hammered dulcimer. A new theme for Jon Snow, previously using only the House Stark theme, was created in the sixth season and prominently featured in the episode \"Battle of the Bastards\".

House Lannister has an associated song, \"The Rains of Castamere\", which became their theme.  The song was played at the Red Wedding, but first heard when Tyrion Lannister whistled a small part in the first episode of the second season.  When a theme has become established, different versions that are darker or lighter are then introduced, and concepts such as honor and conspiracy are also represented in themes.\\n\\nDjawadi chose distinctive sounds and instruments for different leitmotifs and themes, for example, didgeridoos are used for the wildlings, while the Armenian duduk flute is used for the Dothrakis.

The themes for the White Walkers and the Night King are more of sound designs rather than regular themes; the White Walker theme initially employed a glass harmonica for a \"really high, eerie, icy sound\", but became fully orchestral when the army of the dead was revealed in the season two finale.  The theme music for the White Walker extended over time into the music of the Army of the Dead, representing the gathering strength of Army of the Dead, which was only introduced in full in the finale of the seventh season when the Wall fell.\\n\\nThe themes may evolve over time in the series.  The theme for Daenerys Targaryen started small, but became grander as she became more powerful. Her theme was initially played with a single instrument such as a processed cello, but later began incorporating more instruments, including Japanese taiko-inspired drums, Indonesian bedug drums, and an Armenian duduk flute.  Syllables and words in Valyrian, a fictional language of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\', are also used in her theme music, although not as whole sentences.

For the dragons, the theme was first heard when they hatched at the end of season one as a quiet high-pitched melody, but developed into something more powerful by the time they became fully grown, for example it was played with French horns in the loot train attack scene in the seventh season.\\n\\nDifferent themes may also be combined in some themes and scenes. For example, in Season 5, the music for House of Black and White is an extension from the themes for Arya and Jaqen H'ghar. During the first scene of the fourth season, as Ice, the Stark sword, is reforged by Tywin Lannister, the Starks' and Lannisters' themes are clearly played simultaneously, to finally end with the Lannister theme only. In the finale of Season 6 with the shot of the armada at the end, at least five themes were combined – themes for Daenerys, Theon, the Unsullied, the dragons, and the main title.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 7}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '4748be2f674df644d9901d30d11ac629'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': '===List of themes===\\n\\n;Houses\\n*House Baratheon (\"The King\\'s Arrival\")\\n*House Bolton (\"Reek\", \"Let\\'s Play a Game\")\\n*House Greyjoy (\"What Is Dead May Never Die\", \"Ironborn\")\\n*House Lannister (\"A Lannister Always Pays His Debts\", \"The Rains of Castamere\")\\n*House Martell (\"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\", \"Jaws of the Viper\")\\n*House Stark (\"Goodbye Brother\", \"Home\", \"The Last of the Starks\")\\n*House Targaryen (\"Fire and Blood\")\\n*House Tyrell (\"Service of the Gods\")\\n\\n;Groups\\n*Army of the Dead (\"The Army of the Dead\")\\n*Children of the Forest (\"He Is Lost\")\\n*Dothraki (\"To Vaes Dothrak\")\\n*Dragons (\"Breaker of Chains\", \"Blood of the Dragon\")\\n*The Living (\"The Night King\")\\n*Night\\'s Watch (\"The Night\\'s Watch\")\\n*Red Priests (\"Warrior of Light\", \"The Red Woman\")\\n*Sons of the Harpy (\"Sons of the Harpy\")\\n*Thenns (\"Thenns\", \"Let\\'s Kill Some Crows\")\\n*The Undying (\"Pyat Pree\")\\n*Unsullied (\"Dracarys\", \"Casterly Rock\")\\n*White Walkers (\"White Walkers\")\\n*Wildlings (\"We Are the Watchers on the Wall\")\\n\\n;Characters (with themes different than their House theme)\\n*Arya Stark (\"The Pointy End\", \"Needle\", \"The Children\")\\n*Brienne of Tarth (\"The Old Gods and the New\", \"Feed the Hounds\", used as a theme for Catelyn Stark in season 1)\\n*Cersei Lannister (\"Light of the Seven\")\\n*Daenerys Targaryen (\"Finale\", \"Mhysa\")\\n*Euron Greyjoy (\"Coronation\")\\n*High Sparrow (\"High Sparrow\")\\n*Jaime Lannister (\"Kingslayer\")\\n*Jaqen H\\'ghar (\"Valar Morghulis\")\\n*Joffrey Baratheon (\"You Win or You Die\")\\n*Jon Snow (\"My Watch Has Ended\", \"Bastard\")\\n*The Mountain (\"I Choose Violence\")\\n*Three-Eyed Raven (\"Three-Eyed Raven\")\\n*Samwell Tarly (\"Maester\")\\n*Stannis Baratheon (\"Warrior of Light\", \"Don\\'t Die With a Clean Sword\")\\n*Petyr Baelish (\"Chaos is a Ladder\")\\n*The Night King (\"The Night King\")\\n\\n;Locations\\n* The Citadel (\"Maester\")\\n* House of Black and White (\"Valar Morghulis\", \"House of Black and White\")\\n* Meereen (\"Meereen\")\\n* Qarth (\"Qarth\")\\n* The Wall (\"The Wall\")\\n* Winterfell (\"Winterfell\")\\n\\n;Couples\\n*Daenerys and Khal Drogo (\"Love in the Eyes\")\\n*Daenerys and Jon Snow (\"Truth\", \"The Iron Throne\")\\n*Greyworm and Missandei (\"I\\'m Sorry for Today\")\\n*Jon Snow and Ygritte (\"You Know Nothing\", \"The Real North\")\\n*Robb Stark and Talisa (\"I Am Hers, She Is Mine\", also used as a love theme in general)\\n*Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth (“The White Book”)\\n\\n;Other\\n*The Long Night (\"The Night King\", \"Farewell\")\\n*Conspiracy (\"Chaos Is a Ladder\", \"The Dagger\")\\n\\n==Other compositions and songs==\\nVarious pieces of music are also composed for particular plot lines in the series.

She said she understood the idea of power corrupting \"a heroic figure like Daenerys\" and Daenerys falling prey to a messiah complex, but that the show needed to evolve her to that point like it evolved other characters to their points.

Also stating that \"there are many ways to interpret\" Daenerys\\'s decision to burn the city, Megan Garber of \\'\\'The Atlantic\\'\\' said that maybe it was the Targaryen madness having settled in, or her ruthlessness taking over, or a \"crazy edit\" by the writers, or a decision \"that some innocents must die in the present so that many more can live peacefully in the future,\" or maybe that Daenerys \"having recently lost her second dragon and the apparent loyalty of those left in her orbit, she simply made a blunt calculation about power and what will be required to attain it.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 11}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b7da30aeea78e95233351d088fa4428c'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': 'Garber said that \"ambiguity is a powerful tool in storytelling,\" but that \"it is also a difficult one to wield well,\" and that \"Dany is a savior, and Dany is a monster, and it is impossible to know where one ends and the other begins.\"To Garber, this uncertainty made Daenerys\\'s actions all the more horrific because logic will not always win and \"justice won\\'t always save the day.\"Showrunners David Benioff and D.

House Tarth is a bannerman to House Baratheon, the lord paramount of the Stormlands.

She told Brienne that although a man would marry her, as she is heir to her father's land, he could never desire her.\\n\\nBrienne's father tried to find her a suitor to wed. This proved to be difficult, however, due to both Brienne's resistance and her ungainly appearance. Nonetheless, three successive but ultimately unsuccessful betrothals were attempted. The first was when she was 7 and her fiance was 10, but he died of an illness. Next, a betrothal was brokered by the lord of the land-poor house Connington, to his young newly knighted heir Ronnet, but young Ser Ronnet broke the betrothal the first time he met Brienne.\\n\\nBrienne's father's last attempt was to betroth her at 16 to Ser Humfrey Wagstaff, a middle aged friend of his, who was castellan of another house. Humfrey informed Brienne that she was expected to give up her training and become more feminine after their wedding. Brienne rejoined that she would acquiesce, but only if Wagstaff could beat her in combat. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 2}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '5a9d6c9ceb42e5141482d616aee1d1af'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': \"Their fight resulted in three broken bones and a broken betrothal.\\n\\nBrienne had begged Tarth's master-at-arms Ser Goodwin to teach her skill at arms.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''.\\n\\nIntroduced in 1998's ''A Clash of Kings'', Ramsay is the bastard son of Roose Bolton, the lord of the Dreadfort, an ancient fortress in the North of the kingdom of Westeros. He is subsequently mentioned in ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000) and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005). He later appears in Martin's ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011). Ramsay is an amoral and vicious sadist who strives to be legitimized as a true Bolton by his father. He is directly responsible for several atrocities in both the novels and television show, including the brutal torture of Theon Greyjoy; however, his role as a primary antagonist is greatly expanded in the television adaptation.\\n\\nRamsay is portrayed by Welsh actor Iwan Rheon in the HBO television adaptation. Rheon has received critical acclaim for his performance, although his character's reception has been more polarized; he is widely considered to be one of the show's most brutal and hated villains. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'af428354700d3cc7586762def6896fe3'}&gt;,\n  &lt;Document: {'content': 'In 2016, \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\' referred to the character as \"arguably the most hated man on television\" and \"the signature \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' villain\". In 2019, the Red Cross conducted a study using international human rights laws, and determined Ramsay to be the \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' character who committed the most war crimes, with seventeen violations.\\n\\n==Character==\\nRamsay Bolton is not a point of view character in the novels, and remains mostly in the background.  His actions are witnessed and interpreted directly through the eyes of Theon Greyjoy, and indirectly from stories heard by Bran Stark and Davos Seaworth.\\n\\n===Background===\\nRamsay is the product of rape. While hunting along the Weeping Water, Roose Bolton saw a miller\\'s wife and decided to illicitly practice the banned tradition of \\'the first night\\', wherein a lord had the right to bed a commoner\\'s bride. He hanged the miller under a tree for not informing his lord of his marriage to the woman and raped her beneath his swaying body. A year later the woman arrived at the Dreadfort with the newborn Ramsay.

Roose then gave the woman the mill along with a pig, several chicks and a bag of coin every year on the condition that she never reveal to Ramsay the truth about who his father was.\\n\\nRamsay\\'s mother arrived at the castle years later claiming she needed help in raising Ramsay, who had grown up wild and unruly. Roose sent Ramsay a servant known as Reek. Reek, despite taking constant washes, always smelled bad due to some \"unknown birth condition\" that caused his skin to reek, thus his nickname. Giving him to Ramsay and his mother was actually a cruel jest by Roose, but Ramsay and Reek soon grew inseparable.
