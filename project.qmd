## Featured Project

### Manim Code Generation with LLM Fine-tuning

**Description**: Fine-tuned a small language model on the Manim dataset using instruction tuning methodology. The model generates executable Manim code that produces mathematical animations from natural language descriptions.

**Technologies**: 
- LLM Fine-tuning
- Instruction Tuning
- Code Generation
- Manim

**Status**: Completed

## Learning Journey

My learning process and experiments are documented in the [Blog](blog.qmd) section, covering topics like:

- Deep Learning fundamentals (fast.ai course)
- Transformers and NLP (Hugging Face course)
- Building LLMs from scratch
- GPU Programming and CUDA
- PyTorch internals

## Coming Soon

More projects are in development as I dive deeper into CUDA kernel engineering and low-level ML optimization. Check back soon or follow my progress in the blog!
