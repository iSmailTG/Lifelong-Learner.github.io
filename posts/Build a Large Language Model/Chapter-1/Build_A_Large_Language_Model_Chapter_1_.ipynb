    "* The aim of this chapter is to introduce the foundational concepts of large language models (LLMs) and the advancements in deep learning that made them possible\n",
    "  - this chapter doesn't contain any code.\n",
    "* Large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI's ChatGPT, are deep neural networks that revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) in recent years.\n",
    "* Traditional NLP methods excelled in tasks like spam classification and simple pattern recognition but struggled with complex tasks requiring advanced understanding and generation abilities.\n",
    "* Contemporary LLMs can handle sophisticated language tasks, such as writing an email from keywords, which was challenging for earlier models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we say language models \"understand,\" we mean they can produce text that seems coherent and contextually appropriate, not that they have human-like awareness or true comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The transformer architecture and large datasets have driven the shift in NLP, enabling more advanced language understanding and interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's an LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM's are neural network designed to understand and produce huma-like text.\n",
    "* Large in LLM refer to the size of the datasets those model trained on, but also on the size of parameters ( 100's of billions)\n",
    "  - Parameters are adjusted weights during training to predict next word in sentence.\n",
    "* The architecture of an LLM is called `transformers` which apply the `attention mechanism` to different parts of the input while performing the next word prediction.\n",
    "### Applications of LLM's:\n",
    "* LLM's can be used in many contexts to perform different tasks:\n",
    "  - machine translation\n",
    "  - sentiments analysis\n",
    "  - text generation  \n",

    "### Stages of building and using LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Building LLM form scratch allow us to understand the **mechanics** and **limitations** of language models, and provide us with skills set required for pretraining or fine-tuning phase.\n",
    "* Custom-built LLM outperform general purpose one.\n",
    "   - Many companies prefer to build their own domain-specific llm to keep their private data in-home and not share it with third party.\n",
    "   - developing small lm open the door for deployment on devices like laptops or even mobiles rather than huge servers.\n",
    "* creating LLM is a process where pre-training and fine-tuning takes place.\n",
    "    - `pre` indicates that it is the first phase, model is trained on huge chunk of data where it learns basic knowledge and broad pattern of the language.\n",
    "    - the `fine-tuning` phase is where the model get further training but on very specific task and get its knowledge narrowed.\n",
    "* Fine-tuning can be devised in 2 category:\n",
    "    - **Instruction fine-tuning**: where the model get trained one pair of **instruction => output** dataset.\n",
    "    - Where **classification tuning** the data consist of text and associated class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introducing the Transformer architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All modern LLM rely on **Transformer** architecture which was presented for the first time in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) famous paper: **Attention is all you need**.\n",
    "* Transformer consist of two submodal: 1-encoder and 2-decoder.\n",
    "      - encoder module process the input text into some numerical representation that capture meaning.  \n",
    "      - decoder uses the numerical values and generate text  \n",
    "* the key component of the transformer architecture is attention mechanism, we will talk about it later.\n",
    "* **Transformer Variants**:  \n",
    "      - Models like BERT and GPT are based on the original transformer architecture but adapt it for different tasks.  \n",
    "      - **BERT’s Training Strategy**: BERT uses a masked word prediction approach, where it predicts missing words in a sentence, making it suitable for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.  \n",
    "      - **GPT vs. BERT**: GPT is designed for generative tasks, whereas BERT excels in tasks requiring understanding of context, like sentiment prediction and document categorization.  \n",
    "      - **BERT’s Real-world Application**: Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) use BERT for tasks such as detecting toxic content.\n",
    "* **GPT Focus**: GPT utilizes the *Decoder* portion of the transformer architecture and is designed for text generation tasks.\n",
    "* **Zero-shot and Few-shot Learning**: GPT models excel in zero-shot learning, meaning they can handle tasks without specific prior examples. They also perform well in few-shot learning, where they learn from a small number of provided examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Versatility**: While GPT models are optimized for text completion, they exhibit broad adaptability and can tackle a wide range of tasks, showcasing their flexibility in natural language processing.\n",
