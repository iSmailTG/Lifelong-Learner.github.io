I'd be happy to continue with the Mini-GPT training code. Let's finish the implementation:

Now, let's add a script that allows us to compare the two types of positional embeddings in the context of our Mini-GPT model, to see how they affect performance:

Let me also provide a detailed explanation of the code implementation and key concepts:

## Positional Embeddings Implementation

The first artifact implements two types of positional embeddings, which are crucial for transformer models like GPT:

### 1. Learned Positional Embeddings

- **Implementation**: An embedding layer that maps position indices to vectors
- **Key characteristics**:
  - Parameters are learned during training
  - More flexible as they can adapt to specific patterns in the data
  - Requires additional memory for storing parameters
  - Limited to the maximum sequence length seen during training

### 2. Sinusoidal Positional Embeddings

- **Implementation**: Mathematical functions (sine and cosine) with different frequencies
- **Key characteristics**:
  - Fixed pattern that doesn't require training
  - More memory-efficient (no additional parameters)
  - Can potentially generalize better to sequence lengths not seen during training
  - Uses alternating sine and cosine functions across dimensions

The code includes visualization capabilities to see how these different embeddings look across positions and dimensions.

## Mini-GPT Implementation

The second artifact implements a simplified GPT model with these key components:

### Key Components:

1. **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence
   - Splits embeddings into multiple heads for parallel attention computation
   - Computes query, key, and value projections
   - Uses scaled dot-product attention with a causal mask for autoregressive generation

2. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Processes the attention outputs
   - Two linear transformations with a GELU activation
   - Expands the dimension to `d_ff` and then back to `d_model`

3. **Decoder Blocks**: The fundamental building blocks of GPT
   - Self-attention mechanism
   - Feed-forward network
   - Layer normalization and residual connections

4. **Text Generation**: Autoregressive sampling with temperature control
   - Supports top-k and nucleus (top-p) sampling for diverse generation
   - Follows the standard autoregressive text generation process

5. **Simple Tokenizer**: A basic implementation for demonstration purposes
   - Handles word tokenization
   - Builds vocabulary from input texts
   - Provides encode/decode functionality

## Training Implementation

The third artifact shows how to train the Mini-GPT model:

- Sets up proper loss function (CrossEntropyLoss with padding ignored)
- Uses the AdamW optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- Implements gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
- Tracks and visualizes training metrics
- Demonstrates text generation with different temperature settings

## Comparison of Positional Embeddings

The final artifact compares both positional embedding types in a real training scenario:

- Implements both models with identical architectures except for the positional embedding type
- Trains both models on the same data with identical hyperparameters
- Compares training loss curves and training times
- Tests text generation quality
- Assesses generalization to longer sequences (a key advantage of sinusoidal embeddings)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Architectural Understanding**: The code demonstrates the essential components of transformer decoder models like GPT.

2. **Positional Embeddings Trade-offs**:
   - Learned positional embeddings can adapt to specific patterns but require more parameters and may struggle with longer sequences.
   - Sinusoidal positional embeddings are parameter-efficient and theoretically better for generalization to unseen sequence lengths.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The implementation includes training, evaluation, and text generation, forming a complete pipeline from data to generated text.

These implementations provide a foundation to understand how modern language models work at their core, with a focus on the critical role of positional information in sequence modeling.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of these implementations in more detail?
