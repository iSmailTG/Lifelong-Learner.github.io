    "## Motivation:\n",
    "- In this series of lessons, I will track my learning through the universe of C++ as someone who mainly program in Python.\n",
    "- The motivation behind learning C++ in 2025 can be resumed into one word: **Cuda**.\n",
    "- CUDA kernels are still C++ first, Python second. Learning the bare-metal steps so I can stop guessing and start writing fast GPU code. One small page a day until the compiler feels normal.\n",
    "- This idea of learning C++ for CUDA make it less intimidating, since C++ isn't the goal here  rather just a tool for something else.\n",
    "- But still I need to learn some basics of C++ in order to navigate its world that already after one studying session looks very strange and outlandish for a Python programmer."

    "## C++ World:\n",
    "- C++ is a **Compiled language**, which means the code goes through a transformation process before it can run.\n",
    "- In C++, we write code then a special program called **Compiler** translates our *Human-readable* code into machine code (1s & 0s) that computer can executes.\n",
    "- This process of compiling works in **4 stages**:\n",
    "  * Stage1: Pre-processing before the compiler even looks at our code, it's a text manipulation step where the preprocessor check code that starts with `#` and  copy-past, find-replace it automatically, so the next step include only pure C++ code.\n",
    "  * Stage2: The compiler reads the C++ code and converts it to **Assembly Language**, which is a human readable instructions that are very close to machine code.\n",
    "  * Stage3: An **Assembler** converts assembly into actual `1s` & `0s` that the CPU understands.\n",
    "  * Stage4: A **Linker** connects everything together (code, libraries, other file..) and creates the final executable file that can run."

    "\n",
    "* In order to use libraries and tools in C++ we use the keyword **`#include`**, it's equivalent to `import` in Python.\n",
    "* Library we used here is `iostream` which allows us to print in the screen and many more things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **All C++ programs** has one `main()` function, it's the starting point of every program, The `main` function is called automatically when a C++ program begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Printing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* By using **`cout`** we can print text on the screen.\n",
    "* More than one piece of data can be printed at a time.\n",
    "* **`endl`** is used after **`cout`** to end the line, so the next **`cout`** could starts printing next line.\n",
    "* We can print multiple pieces of data if we **seperate** them with **`<<`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statements:\n",
    "* The lines of code inside `main` function are called `statements`.\n",
    "* All statements in C++ must end with semi-colon **;**.\n",
    "* **The compiler** reads our code and turns it into instructions that a computer can understand (machine instructions).\n",
    "* Then the compiler will generate an executable program which is just a file filled with machine instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The compiler uses the semi-colons to know where each statement ends. If you do not include a semi-colon at the end of every statement then you will get a `syntax error`. A program with syntax errors will not compile and run.\n",
    "#### String:\n",
    "* The thing printed to the screen is called string, which refers to a groupr of characters inside `\"\"`.\n",
    "#### Comments:\n",
    "* As in python comments are non executable code that we put beside the code in order to explain for us or others ideas or concepts in the code.\n",
    "* In C++ the comment starts with //.\n",
    "* There are two types of comments:  \n",
    "       - single line comments and multi-line comments. All code in between a /* and  a */ are called multi-line comments. They will also be ignored by the compiler. When you have a lot to say in a comment you will use these"
