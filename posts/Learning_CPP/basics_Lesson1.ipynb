    "## Motivation:\n",
    "- In this series of lessons, I will track my learning through the universe of C++ as someone who mainly programm in Python.\n",
    "- The motivation behind learning C++ in 2025 can be resumed into one word: **Cuda**.\n",
    "- CUDA kernels are still C++ first, Python second. Learning the bare-metal steps so I can stop guessing and start writing fast GPU code. One small page a day until the compiler feels normal.\n",
    "- This idea of learning C++ for CUDA make it less intimidating, since C++ isn't the goal here  rather just a tool for something else.\n",
    "- But still I need to learn some basics of C++ in order to navigate its world that already after one studying session looks very strange and outlandish for a Python programmer."

    "## C++ World:\n",
    "- C++ is a **Compiled language**, which means the code goes through a transformation process before it can run.\n",
    "- In C++, we write codem then a special program called **Compiler** translates our *Human-readable* code into machine code (1s & 0s) that computer can executes.\n",
    "- This process of compiling works in **4 stages**:\n",
    "  * Stage1: Pre-processing before the compiler even looks at our code, it's a text manipulation step where the preprocessor check code that starts with `#` and  copy-past, find-replace it automatically, so the next step include only pure C++ code.\n",
    "  * Stage2: The compiler reads the C++ code and converts it to **Assembly Language**, which is a human readable instructions that are very close to machine code.\n",
    "  * Stage3: An **Assembler** converts assembly into actual `1s` & `0s` that the CPU understands.\n",
    "  * Stage4: A **Linker** connects everything together (code, libraries, other file..) and creates the final executable file that can run."
